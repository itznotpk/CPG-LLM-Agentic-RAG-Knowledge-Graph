### Overview

This algorithm classifies ED patients with cardiovascular disease for safe treatment selection.

> **Note:** If vasculogenic ED, perform ASCVD risk score assessment.

---

### Step 1: Starting Point

**Patients with confirmed ED**

↓

### Step 2: Exercise Ability Assessment<sup>a</sup>

Assess the patient's exercise ability to estimate cardiovascular risk.

↓

### Step 3: Cardiac Risk Stratification

**Cardiac risk stratification according to Princeton Consensus***

> *Refer to Table 1 for cardiac risk stratification for patients with ED based on 2nd and 3rd Princeton Consensus.

↓

Classify into one of three risk categories:

---

### Step 4: Risk-Based Pathways

#### Low Risk Pathway

**Low Risk** → Elective risk assessment (optional)

↓ (or optionally → **Stress test<sup>b</sup>** → if Pass → proceed below)

**For advice and treatment by primary team**

↓

Continue to Step 5 (Nitrate Assessment)

---

#### Intermediate Risk Pathway

**Intermediate Risk** → **Stress test<sup>b</sup>**

↓

| Test Result | Next Step |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Pass** | Reclassify as **Low Risk** → For advice and treatment by primary team |
| **Fail** | Reclassify as **High Risk** → For further cardiac assessment |

---

#### High Risk Pathway

**High Risk** → **For further cardiac assessment**

(Treatment deferred until cardiac condition stabilized)

---

### Step 5: Nitrate Assessment (After Risk Classification)

For patients cleared for treatment (Low Risk):

#### Decision: Is the patient prescribed nitrate/riociguat?

| Patient Status | Treatment Path |
|----------------|----------------|
| **No** (not on nitrates) | → **PDE5i** (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) |
| **Yes** (on nitrates) | → Check: Is nitrate necessary? |

#### If on nitrates, is nitrate necessary?

| Answer | Treatment Path |
|--------|----------------|
| **Yes** (nitrate essential) | → **Non-PDE5i treatment** |
| **No** (nitrate can be stopped) | → **Consider stopping nitrate, then PDE5i** |

patient_input: symptoms, medical_history, physical_exam_findings, lab_results
output: ED_type, ED_severity, cardiovascular_risk_level
-->

## Overview
Assessment and diagnosis of ED should always begin with a detailed medical, sexual and psychological history of the patients and, when available, their partners. The history should include information about past and current sexual relationships, previous consultations and treatments.

---

## 2.1 Medical History, Physical Examination and Laboratory Testing

### 2.1.1 History Taking

A detailed history aided by validated questionnaires (IIEF-15 or IIEF-5) helps to assess different sexual function domains:
- Sexual desire
- Erectile function
- Orgasmic function
- Intercourse satisfaction
- Overall satisfaction

| Assessment Tool | Use Case | Evidence |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **IIEF-15** | Comprehensive assessment of all sexual function domains | Level III |
| **IIEF-5** | Quick screening, severity classification | Level III |
| **EHS (Erection Hardness Score)** | Penile rigidity assessment (correlation 0.63-0.86 with IIEF)  except the sexual desire domain. | Level III |

> **Clinical Note:** IIEF-5 and EHS assessment helps determine ED severity and guides treatment selection.

#### Mandatory Screening

| Screen For | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Hypogonadism symptoms | Decreased energy, decreased libido |
| Diabetes mellitus | Major risk factor (59.1% ED prevalence) |
| Cardiovascular risk factors | ED may be early marker of systemic vascular dysfunction |

---

### 2.1.2 Physical Examination
Patients should undergo physical examination and vital parameters recording during clinical examination as part of cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Focus areas for examination:**

| System | Examination Focus | Looking For |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Genitourinary** | Penis, testes, prostate | Peyronie's disease, pre-malignant/malignant lesions, prostatic enlargement |
| **Endocrine** | Secondary sexual characteristics | Small testes, alterations suggesting hypogonadism |
| **Vascular** | Peripheral pulses, BP | Vascular insufficiency markers |
| **Neurological** | Sensation, reflexes | Neurogenic causes |

**Vital Parameters to Record:**
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- BMI or waist circumference (cardiovascular risk assessment)

> **Clinical Note:** A physical examination may reveal penile abnormalities, e.g. Peyronie's disease, pre-malignant or malignant genital lesions, prostatic enlargement and signs suggestive of hypogonadism (e.g. small testes or alterations in secondary sexual characteristics).


---

### 2.1.3 Laboratory Testing

Laboratory testing must be tailored to patient's symptoms and risk factors to identify modifiable risk factors.

#### Routine Tests (for CV Risk Assessment)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Fasting blood glucose OR HbA1c | Screen for diabetes |
| Lipid profile | Cardiovascular risk assessment |

#### Additional Tests (Case-by-Case Basis)

Additional laboratory tests may be considered on a case-by-case basis e.g. hormonal tests:
- Early morning total testosterone
- Total prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
- Prolactin
- Luteinizing hormone (LH)

---

### 2.1.4 Advanced Work-Up

> Most patients with ED can be managed based on their medical and sexual history. specific diagnostic tests are reserved for specific indications.

#### 2.1.4.1 Nocturnal Penile Tumescence and Rigidity Test (NPTR)

**Procedure:** Device worn overnight for at least 2 separate nights

**Information Obtained:**
- Number of erectile episodes
- Tumescence (circumference change by strain gauges)
- Maximal penile rigidity
- Duration of nocturnal erections

**Interpretation:**

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Erection ≥10 min + ≥60% stiffness at tip | Functional erectile mechanism |
| Normal NPTR | Suggests psychogenic ED |
| Abnormal NPTR | Suggests organic ED |

> **Limitation:** Routine use may be limited due to confounding factors (e.g., dreams) affecting nocturnal erection.

---

#### 2.1.4.2 Intracavernous Injection Test

Performed with or without dynamic duplex Doppler ultrasound to confirm vasculogenic aetiology.

**Normal Parameters:**

| Parameter | Normal Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Peak systolic blood flow | >30 cm/s |
| End-diastolic velocity | <3 cm/s |
| Resistance index | >0.8 |

---

#### 2.1.4.3 Arteriography

| Indication | Test Type |
|------------|-----------|
| Candidates for penile revascularisation | Penile pudendal arteriography |
| ED with isolated penile artery stenosis | computed tomography angiography (prior to penile artery angioplasty) |

---

#### Indications for Advanced Diagnostic Tests

| Indication | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Primary ED | Not caused by acquired organic disease or psychogenic disorder |
| Young patients with trauma history | Pelvic or perineal trauma, suspected vasculogenic ED |
| Penile deformities requiring surgical correction | Peyronie's disease, congenital penile curvature |
| Complex endocrine disorders | Unusual hormonal patterns |
| Complex psychiatric/psychosexual disorders | Refractory cases |
| Medico-legal reasons | implantation of penile prosthesis to documentation end-stage ED, sexual abuse cases |

## 2.3 Psychological and Sexual Assessment

<!-- METADATA
category: psychological_assessment
use_case: psychogenic_ED_evaluation
-->

Psychosocial and sexual history is important for thorough and comprehensive assessment. These can be assessed through clinical interviews and objective measurements on specific areas of history which include:

- **Current psychological state** and co-morbid psychiatry conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression)
- **Relationship history** - issues, dynamics, durations and partner history
- **Partner's sexual functioning** (e.g. FSD)
- **Life stressors** and coping abilities
- **Cognitive factors:**
  - Dysfunctional thinking style
  - Expectations on sexuality and sexual performance, and treatment preferences
- **Sexual-related factors:**
  - Education
  - Trauma
  - Experience (e.g. masturbation, pornography usage)
  - Cultural and religious aspects
  - Gender dysphoria and sexual orientation
- **Co-morbid sexual dysfunction** (e.g. premature ejaculation)

---

### Recommendation 1: Diagnosis and Assessment

- A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should be taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED).
- A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess all sexual function domains (e.g. International Index of Erectile Function).
- A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men with ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions and co-morbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED.
- Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modifiable risk factors of ED.
- Specific diagnostic tests may be performed when it is indicated*.
- Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice versa.

> *Refer to preceding text in Subchapter 2.1.4 (Advanced Work-Up).

# SECTION 3: TREATMENT

<!-- METADATA
category: treatment
use_case: treatment_selection, care_plan_generation
patient_input: ED_severity, cardiovascular_risk, patient_preferences
output: treatment_pathway
-->

## Overview

ED can be treated with multiple therapeutic options. These include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological agents, mechanical devices, surgeries and psychological interventions. It should be a dynamic process resulting in a patient-centred treatment strategy that depends on the effectiveness, safety and cost of the treatment. Shared decision-making (preferably with a partner) is essential throughout the management of ED.

---

## 3.1 Lifestyle Intervention

ED is strongly associated with lifestyle risk factors. Addressing these factors is important in the treatment of ED.

### Evidence Summary

| Intervention | Effect | Evidence |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **CV risk factor modifications** (physical activity, Mediterranean diet, weight loss) | Improved IIEF-5 score (MD=2.40, 95% CI 1.19-3.61) compared with those not receiving the interventions | Level I |
| **Aerobic exercise** (moderate-vigorous intensity, ≥3x/week, ≥30 min/session) | Improved IIEF/IIEF-5 for arterial ED  for men with arterial ED due to physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and/or CVD compared with controls | Level I |
| **Weight loss** (low-energy diet + physical exercises) | Improved erectile function (MD of IIEF=1.99, 95% CI 0.85-3.13) | Level I |
| **Bariatric surgery** (BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with co-morbidities) | Significantly improved IIEF scores | Level II-3 |
| **Pelvic floor muscle training** (5-20 therapist-supervised sessions, 3-4 months) | 35-47% cure rate in ED | Level II-3 |
| **Smoking cessation** | Improved ED irrespective of pack-years and severity | Level II-3 |
| **Alcohol abstinence** (3 months) | Improved IIEF-5 scores (p<0.001) | Level II-2 |

### Stress Management and Psychotherapy

In managing stress, counselling is helpful as an initial step to provide support and guidance regarding ED.

Psychotherapy, on the other hand, goes one step further and is directed towards gaining insights into chronic and recurrent emotional and cognitive patterns, and their contribution to ED (refer to Subchapter 3.5 Psychological Interventions).

> **EAU Guidelines 2023:** Modify risk factors and commence lifestyle changes prior to or concurrently with ED treatments.

### Recommendation 2

- All patients with erectile dysfunction should be advised on lifestyle and risk factor modifications.

---

## 3.2 Pharmacological Treatment

The main pharmacological agents for ED are phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5is). These agents cause corporeal smooth muscle relaxation, increased arterial blood flow and compression of sub-tunical venous plexus leading to erection.

> **Important:** PDE5is are not initiators of erection; they require environmental and psychological cues for sufficient sexual arousal and stimulation to facilitate an erection.

### 3.2.1 Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5i)

#### PDE5i Comparison Table

| Drug | Onset | Duration | Initial Dose | Max Dose | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Sildenafil** | 30-60 min | Up to 12h | 50 mg | 100 mg | First PDE5i available in market |
| **Tadalafil** | - | - | 10 mg (on-demand) or 2.5 mg (daily) | 20 mg (on-demand) or 5 mg (daily) | 5 mg daily more effective than placebo for LUTS/BPH/ED |
| **Avanafil** | ≤15 min | >6 hours | - | - | Onset/duration from RCT in DM patients |
| **Vardenafil** | - | - | - | - | *Not registered in Malaysia* |

#### Sildenafil

- First available PDE5i; recommended initial dose 50 mg
- Improved IIEF-5 scores in patients with DM and/or hypertension (from 13.6±5.7 to 21.7±4.1 at 12 weeks)
- Common AEs: headache (5.5%), flushing (1.9%), nasal congestion (1.3%)

#### Tadalafil

- Tadalafil was well tolerated although the AEs were not specified.
- Available as on-demand (10-20 mg) or once-daily (2.5-5 mg) regimen
- 5 mg once-daily more effective than 20 mg on-demand at 12 weeks (WMD=1.51, 95% CI 0.49-2.53)
- Higher risk of myalgia and back pain compared to sildenafil; lower risk of flushing

#### Avanafil

- 200 mg dose significantly better than 100 mg in IIEF score and successful intercourse
- For AEs, avanafil had a higher risk compared with placebo (RR=1.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.31). 
- Effective in DM and ED patients; can be initiated in ≤15 minutes
- Common AEs: headache, nasopharyngitis, flushing, sinus congestion

#### Vardenafil

- Significantly more effective than placebo in IIEF-overall satisfaction, SEP2 and SEP3 scores
- **Not registered in Malaysia**

> **Safety Alert:** Patients should stop PDE5i and seek immediate medical care for sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes (possible NAION). Patients with history of NAION may be prescribed PDE5i with caution.

### Recommendation 3

- Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with erectile dysfunction unless contraindicated.
- The choice of agent is individualised.

---

### 3.2.2 Combination Therapy

Combination of PDE5i with various agents (alpha-blocker, testosterone, antioxidants) was more effective than PDE5i monotherapy (WMD in IIEF score=1.76, 95% CI 1.27-2.24) with NS difference in AEs.

> **EAU Guidelines 2023:** recommend PDE5is as first-line therapeutic option. Choice of drug depends on frequency of intercourse and patient's personal experience.

---

### 3.2.3 Other Medications

#### Intracavernosal Injection (ICI)

- First medical treatment for ED; only FDA-approved preparation is alprostadil
- Adequate penile rigidity restored in 60.2% of patients
- AEs: pain during self-injection (45.9%), prolonged erection (23-44.4%), penile curvature (14.9%), palpable plaque (10.8%)
- Overall satisfaction: 40.1%
- Caution with anticoagulation (higher bleeding risk, though NS)

#### Intraurethral Alprostadil

Two methods of administration:
1. **MUSE** (Medicated Urethral System for Erection): pellet inserted into urethra
2. **Topical cream**: applied to urethra meatus or glans penis

- MUSE: significant improvement in erection vs placebo, but inferior to ICI
- Topical alprostadil: 74% showed overall improvement in EF
- Common AEs: local pain (29-41%), dizziness with possible hypotension (1.9-14%)
- Rare AEs: penile fibrosis and priapism (<1%)
- If administered into urethra: urethral bleeding (5%), urinary tract infections (0.2%)

> **Note:** ICI and intraurethral alprostadil are treatment options for ED. However, both are not available locally yet.

---

## 3.3 Mechanical Treatment

Mechanical devices have been used with success and are safe to maintain an erection.

### 3.3.1 Vacuum Erection Device (VED)

**Effectiveness:**
- 96.0% reported ability to maintain an erection
- 90.7% able to engage in intercourse
- 92.0% had improved intercourse
- 93.9% reported satisfactory sexual relationship with partner
- 83.8% of female partners rated sex as better
- 23% of patients reported physical discomfort (difficulties placing the bands on cylinder, sliding them on the penis, removing them after sex or pain)
- 9.1% of patients reported psychological discomfort (frustration, lack of spontaneity)

**Combination with PDE5i:**
- VED + sildenafil 100 mg vs sildenafil alone showed significantly higher IIEF scores at one month and three months
- significantly higher rates of successful penetration  and successful intercourse at three months

**AEs:**
- Penile bruising and numbness (mostly mild)

---

### 3.3.2 Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (Li-ESWT)

**Effectiveness:**
- Improved erectile function in young patients with vasculogenic mild ED
- Increased IIEF-EF scores at 3 months (p=0.003)
- Effective from 3-6 months
- Enhanced medication responses in PDE5i non-responders
- When used with daily therapy, increased effectiveness and duration

**Best Candidates:**
- Younger men with mild to moderate ED
- Those with fewer co-morbidities

> **Note:** Li-ESWT should be performed only by urologists as they are involved in entire holistic management and understand mechanisms of action to tailor treatment plan.

### Recommendation 4

- Mechanical devices (e.g. vacuum erection device or shockwave therapy) may be offered in erectile dysfunction (ED).
- Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by urologists for mild to moderate ED.

---

## 3.4 Surgical Intervention

Surgical interventions in ED include penile revascularisation surgery and penile prosthesis (PP).

### 3.4.1 Penile Revascularisation Surgery

#### Arterial Insufficiency (AI)

arterial insufficiency occurs when there is inadequate arterial blood to the penis at the time of erection.

**Candidate Criteria (ICSM Consensus):**
- Age <55 years
- Recently acquired ED from focal arterial occlusive disease
- Absence of other risk factors (e.g. smoking, DM)

**Procedures:** Microsurgery or endovascular intervention (current data do not support one over another)

**Complications:**
- Microsurgery: wound infection (2.8%), UTI (2.6%), wound haematoma (7.8-25%), loss of penile length (28%), decreased penile sensitivity (24.7%)
- Endovascular: vascular injury, puncture site aneurysm, infection, contrast-induced nephropathy

#### Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD)

VOD occurs when erection cannot be achieved/maintained despite adequate arterial supply, due to endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction.

> **ICSM and EAU Guidelines 2023:** Venous surgery or embolisation is NOT recommended for VOD.

---

### 3.4.2 Penile Prosthesis (PP)

Used when other type of treatment modalities have failed.

**Types:**
- Malleable
- 2-piece inflatable
- 3-piece inflatable systems

**Outcomes:**
- Overall patient satisfaction: 85%
- Partner satisfaction: 76%
- 52.9% inflatable PP device survived at 20 years

**AEs:**
- Mechanical failure: <5% in 5 years
- Infection: 2-3% in low-risk patients (higher in revision surgery, immunosuppression, DM, SCI)
- Implant erosion: 1-6%
- Glans ischaemia and necrosis (rare)

> **Note:** Vascular ED should be suspected in patients with ED at younger age with absence of other risk factors.

### Recommendation 5

Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with erectile dysfunction who have failed other interventions.

---

## 3.5 Psychological Intervention

<!-- METADATA
category: treatment
treatment_type: psychological
use_case: psychogenic_ED, mixed_ED
-->

Psychosocial intervention plays a vital role in ED treatment as psychological and social factors often pre-dispose and perpetuate erectile problems. Partner involvement is recommended to identify shared sexual difficulties.

> **Core Components:** Psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioural techniques (reducing anxiety, challenging dysfunctional beliefs), increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance, and increasing intimacy.

### Evidence Summary

| Intervention | Outcome | Evidence |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Focused sex-group therapy** | Reduced persistence of ED vs control (RR=0.13) | Level I |
| **Group therapy + Sildenafil** | Better reduction of persistent ED vs Sildenafil alone (RR=0.46) | Level I |
| **Combined Treatment** (Psych + PDE5i) | Superior to PDE5i or Psych intervention alone (Cohen's d=0.45, RR=2.26) | Level I |
| **Internet-based interventions (IMIs)** | Small effect size (g=0.18) in improving sexual function | Level I |

> **Note:** Combined treatment (PDE5i + Psychological intervention) consistently shows better efficacy than monotherapy for psychogenic or mixed ED.

### Recommendation 6

- An integrated and collaborative approach with psychological interventions should be considered in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
