# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
# ============================================================================
# 
# This workflow deploys the frontend/ folder to GitHub Pages.
# 
# HOW TO REMOVE THIS WORKFLOW:
# 1. Delete this file: .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
# 2. (Optional) Disable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
#    Settings > Pages > Source > "None"
# 3. No other files need to be modified - this workflow is completely
#    self-contained.
