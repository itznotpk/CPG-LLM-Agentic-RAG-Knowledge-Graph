Management of Erectile Dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent and multifaceted medical 
condition characterised by the persistent inability to achieve or 
maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. As a 
widespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life 
of affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress, 
strained relationships and diminished overall well-being.1, level III
ED can manifest in various forms which can be due to organic, 
psychogenic and mixed aetiologies.2 Organic ED may result 
from vascular, neurogenic, hormonal or anatomical factors, while 
psychogenic ED is often associated with psychosocial issues. Mixed 
ED involves a combination of both organic and psychogenic factors, 
making a comprehensive understanding of the condition crucial for 
effective management.
The pathophysiology of ED is complex, involving intricate interplay 
between vascular, neurologic, hormonal and psychological factors. 
Vascular insufficiency, endothelial dysfunction and altered smooth 
muscle tone are common contributors.

Understanding these 
mechanisms is essential for tailoring therapeutic interventions to the 
specific needs of the patient.
In 1995, approximately 150 million men worldwide were estimated to be 
affected by ED and this is likely to double by 2025.3, level III Throughout 
Asia, there is variation in the prevalence rate of ED ranging between 
2.0% and 81.8%.4, level III A local study at five government primary care 
clinics in Petaling District showed that the prevalence of ED for males 
aged 40 to 79 years old was 69.5%. It increased with age from 49.7% 
of men in their 40s to 66.5%, 92.8% and 93.9% of men in their 50s, 60s 
and 70s respectively.5, level III A recent study based on National Health 
and Morbidity Survey 2019 data revealed a prevalence of moderate 
to severe ED in men aged ≥18 years at 31.6% (95% CI 28.8 to
34.6).6, level III
The burden of ED extends beyond its physical manifestations, impacting 
the mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is associated with 
co- morbidities e.g. diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases 
(CVDs) and depression.

Moreover, ED is known to be an early marker 
of systemic vascular dysfunction, emphasising the importance of timely 
diagnosis and intervention.2
Clinical practices for the diagnosis and treatment of ED can vary 
significantly, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, cultural 
perceptions and access to resources. Recognising and addressing 
these variations is crucial to ensure equitable and effective care for the 
affected individuals.

Management of Erectile Dysfunction
In conclusion, this CPG on Management of ED endeavours to provide 
a systematic and culturally sensitive approach to the diagnosis and 
treatment of ED. It is hoped that this CPG can help in optimising 
resource utilisation by providing evidence-based recommendations 
for efficient and safe management of ED. Eventually, this will lead to 
standardised care, improved patient outcomes and reduced the burden 
of ED on affected individuals, their partners and the healthcare system.
