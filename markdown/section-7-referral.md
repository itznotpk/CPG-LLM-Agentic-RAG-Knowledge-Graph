## Referral Indications

### 1. Primary Care Evaluation
The primary care physician has assessed the patient, taken a detailed medical history and performed a physical examination. If the underlying cause of ED is not evident or if there are concerns about specific urological issues, a referral may be appropriate.

### 2. Treatment Failure or Complexity
If initial treatments (e.g. lifestyle changes, oral medications like PDE5i, or other conservative measures) do not yield satisfactory results, or if a case is complex and may require specialised interventions:
- Penile injections
- Vacuum Erection Devices (VEDs)
- Surgical options

A urologist may be consulted.

### 3. Underlying Medical Conditions
Presence of co-morbidities that might contribute to or exacerbate ED:
- Diabetes mellitus
- Cardiovascular disease
- Hormonal disorders

Consultation with a urologist and/or endocrinologist/cardiologist may be warranted.

### 4. Psychological Factors
If psychological factors are suspected to be a significant contributor to the ED, collaboration with a mental health professional may be necessary. However, urologists may still play a role in addressing any physical aspects of the condition.
