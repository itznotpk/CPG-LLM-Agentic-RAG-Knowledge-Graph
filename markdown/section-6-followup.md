## Overview

The follow-up for a patient with ED depends on the individual case and the initial treatment plan.

## Follow-up Types

### Short-term Follow-up
For patients initiating treatment with oral medications, a short-term follow-up within a few weeks to a couple of months may be appropriate to assess:
- Response to medication
- Tolerance to the medication

### Long-term Follow-up
Once a treatment plan has been established, long-term follow-up may be scheduled at regular intervals. This allows for:
- Ongoing assessment of treatment effectiveness
- Potential adjustments to the treatment plan
- Monitoring for any emerging health issues

### As-needed Follow-up
For patients using on-demand treatments or lifestyle modifications, follow-up may be scheduled on an as-needed basis, depending on:
- Their progress
- Any changes in their health status

### Referral Back to Primary Care
If a urologist has been involved in the initial evaluation and management, the urologist may refer the patient back to his primary care physician for ongoing follow-up if the ED is stable and well-managed.

## Key Points

> **Important:** Follow-up plans will vary based on the patient's individual circumstances and response to treatment. Regular communication and collaboration between the primary care physician and the urologist, if involved, are key components of effective care for individuals with ED.
