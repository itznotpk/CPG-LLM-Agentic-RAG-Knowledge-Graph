## Overview
Assessment and diagnosis of ED should always begin with a detailed medical, sexual and psychological history of the patients and, when available, their partners. The history should include information about past and current sexual relationships, previous consultations and treatments.

---

## 2.1 Medical History, Physical Examination and Laboratory Testing

### 2.1.1 History Taking

A detailed history aided by validated questionnaires (IIEF-15 or IIEF-5) helps to assess different sexual function domains:
- Sexual desire
- Erectile function
- Orgasmic function
- Intercourse satisfaction
- Overall satisfaction

| Assessment Tool | Use Case | Evidence |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **IIEF-15** | Comprehensive assessment of all sexual function domains | Level III |
| **IIEF-5** | Quick screening, severity classification | Level III |
| **EHS (Erection Hardness Score)** | Penile rigidity assessment (correlation 0.63-0.86 with IIEF)  except the sexual desire domain. | Level III |

> **Clinical Note:** IIEF-5 and EHS assessment helps determine ED severity and guides treatment selection.

#### Mandatory Screening

| Screen For | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Hypogonadism symptoms | Decreased energy, decreased libido |
| Diabetes mellitus | Major risk factor (59.1% ED prevalence) |
| Cardiovascular risk factors | ED may be early marker of systemic vascular dysfunction |

---

### 2.1.2 Physical Examination
Patients should undergo physical examination and vital parameters recording during clinical examination as part of cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Focus areas for examination:**

| System | Examination Focus | Looking For |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Genitourinary** | Penis, testes, prostate | Peyronie's disease, pre-malignant/malignant lesions, prostatic enlargement |
| **Endocrine** | Secondary sexual characteristics | Small testes, alterations suggesting hypogonadism |
| **Vascular** | Peripheral pulses, BP | Vascular insufficiency markers |
| **Neurological** | Sensation, reflexes | Neurogenic causes |

**Vital Parameters to Record:**
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- BMI or waist circumference (cardiovascular risk assessment)

> **Clinical Note:** A physical examination may reveal penile abnormalities, e.g. Peyronie's disease, pre-malignant or malignant genital lesions, prostatic enlargement and signs suggestive of hypogonadism (e.g. small testes or alterations in secondary sexual characteristics).


---

### 2.1.3 Laboratory Testing

Laboratory testing must be tailored to patient's symptoms and risk factors to identify modifiable risk factors.

#### Routine Tests (for CV Risk Assessment)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Fasting blood glucose OR HbA1c | Screen for diabetes |
| Lipid profile | Cardiovascular risk assessment |

#### Additional Tests (Case-by-Case Basis)

Additional laboratory tests may be considered on a case-by-case basis e.g. hormonal tests:
- Early morning total testosterone
- Total prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
- Prolactin
- Luteinizing hormone (LH)

---

### 2.1.4 Advanced Work-Up

> Most patients with ED can be managed based on their medical and sexual history. specific diagnostic tests are reserved for specific indications.

#### 2.1.4.1 Nocturnal Penile Tumescence and Rigidity Test (NPTR)

**Procedure:** Device worn overnight for at least 2 separate nights

**Information Obtained:**
- Number of erectile episodes
- Tumescence (circumference change by strain gauges)
- Maximal penile rigidity
- Duration of nocturnal erections

**Interpretation:**

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Erection ≥10 min + ≥60% stiffness at tip | Functional erectile mechanism |
| Normal NPTR | Suggests psychogenic ED |
| Abnormal NPTR | Suggests organic ED |

> **Limitation:** Routine use may be limited due to confounding factors (e.g., dreams) affecting nocturnal erection.

---

#### 2.1.4.2 Intracavernous Injection Test

Performed with or without dynamic duplex Doppler ultrasound to confirm vasculogenic aetiology.

**Normal Parameters:**

| Parameter | Normal Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Peak systolic blood flow | >30 cm/s |
| End-diastolic velocity | <3 cm/s |
| Resistance index | >0.8 |

---

#### 2.1.4.3 Arteriography

| Indication | Test Type |
|------------|-----------|
| Candidates for penile revascularisation | Penile pudendal arteriography |
| ED with isolated penile artery stenosis | computed tomography angiography (prior to penile artery angioplasty) |

---

#### Indications for Advanced Diagnostic Tests

| Indication | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Primary ED | Not caused by acquired organic disease or psychogenic disorder |
| Young patients with trauma history | Pelvic or perineal trauma, suspected vasculogenic ED |
| Penile deformities requiring surgical correction | Peyronie's disease, congenital penile curvature |
| Complex endocrine disorders | Unusual hormonal patterns |
| Complex psychiatric/psychosexual disorders | Refractory cases |
| Medico-legal reasons | implantation of penile prosthesis to documentation end-stage ED, sexual abuse cases |

critical: true
use_case: safety_assessment, treatment_eligibility
-->

> **Key Concepts:**
> - ED could be an initial manifestation leading to CAD and peripheral vascular disease
> - Prevalence of ED is >70% among men with CVD

### ED as Cardiovascular Risk Marker

| Association | Risk Ratio/HR | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Severe ED predicts major adverse cardiac event (MACE) | HR 1.75 (95% CI 1.10-2.78) | Level II-2 |
| ED associated with coronary heart disease | RR 1.46 (95% CI 1.31-1.63) | Level II-2 |
| ED associated with stroke | RR 1.35 (95% CI 1.19-1.54) | Level II-2 |
| ED associated with all-cause mortality | RR 1.19 (95% CI 1.05-1.34) | Level II-2 |

### Penile Blood Flow and MACE Risk

| Condition | PSV Threshold | HR for MACE |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Flaccid conditions | <13 cm/s | 2.67 (95% CI 1.42-5.04) |
| Dynamic conditions (post-prostaglandin-E1) | <25 cm/s | 1.57 (95% CI 1.01-2.47) |

### Risk Assessment Tools

For patients with predominantly vasculogenic ED, assess using **2019 ACC/AHA ASCVD risk score** (Princeton IV consensus guidelines recommendation).

## 2.3 Psychological and Sexual Assessment

<!-- METADATA
category: psychological_assessment
use_case: psychogenic_ED_evaluation
-->

Psychosocial and sexual history is important for thorough and comprehensive assessment. These can be assessed through clinical interviews and objective measurements on specific areas of history which include:

- **Current psychological state** and co-morbid psychiatry conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression)
- **Relationship history** - issues, dynamics, durations and partner history
- **Partner's sexual functioning** (e.g. FSD)
- **Life stressors** and coping abilities
- **Cognitive factors:**
  - Dysfunctional thinking style
  - Expectations on sexuality and sexual performance, and treatment preferences
- **Sexual-related factors:**
  - Education
  - Trauma
  - Experience (e.g. masturbation, pornography usage)
  - Cultural and religious aspects
  - Gender dysphoria and sexual orientation
- **Co-morbid sexual dysfunction** (e.g. premature ejaculation)

---

### Recommendation 1: Diagnosis and Assessment

- A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should be taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED).
- A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess all sexual function domains (e.g. International Index of Erectile Function).
- A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men with ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions and co-morbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED.
- Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modifiable risk factors of ED.
- Specific diagnostic tests may be performed when it is indicated*.
- Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice versa.

> *Refer to preceding text in Subchapter 2.1.4 (Advanced Work-Up).
