## Overview

Traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) has been used for the prevention and treatment of ED for many years. The mechanisms of action remain unclear and warrant further clinical investigations.

## Evidence Summary

### Combination Therapy: PDE5i + Antioxidants

A meta-analysis on nine RCTs comparing combination therapy of PDE5i and antioxidants (e.g. propionyl-L-carnitine or L-arginine) with PDE5i monotherapy in patients mainly with ED showed:
- Combination therapy was more effective based on IIEF score (WMD=1.99, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.63)
- No increase in adverse events
- Nine RCTs were mainly of low-risk of bias category (67, level I)

### Red Ginseng

A systematic review assessed various TCMs in the management of ED. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs demonstrated the effectiveness of red ginseng in the treatment of ED compared with placebo:

| Outcome | Effect | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Response rate (based on IIEF score) | RR 2.40 (95% CI 1.65 to 3.51) | Level I |
| Psychogenic ED (based on global efficacy question) | RR 2.05 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.16) | Level I |
| Sexual function (based on IIEF and Watts sexual function score) | SMD 0.79 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.12) | Level I |

> **Note:** The methodological quality of the included RCTs was averagely low.

### Other TCM Findings

| Treatment | Finding | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Yohimbine** | Reasonable therapeutic option compared with placebo; infrequent and reversible AEs | Level I |
| **Acupuncture** | Inconclusive due to scarce evidence | Level I |
| **Tongkat Ali** | Insufficient evidence to recommend use in ED treatment | Level I |
