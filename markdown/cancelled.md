## STATEMENT OF INTENT

This  clinical  practice  guidelines  (CPG)  is  meant  to  be  a  guide  for clinical  practice  based  on  the  best  available  evidence  at  the  time  of development.  The  guideline  should  not  override  the  responsibility  of the practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of the individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and their families or guardians, taking into account the management options available locally.

## UPDATING THE CPG

These guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum period of four years (2028) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will  be  published  in  the  web  version  of  this  document,  which  is  the definitive version at all times. This version can be found on the websites mentioned above.

## FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION

- In  line  with  the  new  development  in  CPG  methodology,  the CPG Unit of MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations, Assessment,  Development  and  Evaluation  (GRADE) in  its work process. The quality of body of evidence and related effect size are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG DG.
-  Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of evidence and  the  wording  used  denotes  the strength  of recommendations . This takes into account:
-  quality and level of the evidence
-  balance of benefits and harms of the options
-  patient's preference and values
-  resource implications
-  relevancy and applicability to the local target population
- The more criteria being fulfilled, the more certain is the evidence leading  to  strong  recommendations  using  the  word  ' should ' being  considered.  Otherwise,  weak  recommendations  use  the word ' may ' in proposing an action to be made.
- In the CPG, a yellow box           highlights important message(s) in the management while a blue box            contains evidence-based recommendation(s) for the particular condition.
-->

## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

The following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG DG as the key recommendations that answer the main questions addressed in the CPG and should be prioritised for implementation.

## DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT

- A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should be taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED).
- A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess all  sexual  function  domains  (e.g.  International  Index  of  Erectile Function).
- A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men with ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions and co-morbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED.
- Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modifiable risk factors of ED.
- Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice versa.

## TREATMENT

- All  patients  with  erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  should  be  advised  on lifestyle and risk factor modifications.
- Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with ED unless contraindicated.
- Mechanical devices (e.g. using vacuum  erection device or shockwave therapy) may be offered in ED. Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by urologists for mild to moderate ED.
- Penile  prothesis  may  be  offered  to  patients  with  ED  who  have failed other interventions.
- An  integrated  and  collaborative  approach  with  psychological interventions should be considered in the treatment of ED.

## GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
<!-- 
## GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT

The members of the DG for this CPG were from the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Higher Education and the private sector. There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.

A  systematic  literature  search  was  carried  out  using  the  following electronic  databases/platforms:  mainly  Medline  via  Ovid  and  others e.g. PubMed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy ). The inclusion criteria are all adults at risk and with erectile dysfunction (ED)  regardless  of  study  design.  The  first  search  was  limited  to literature published in the last 15 years (2007 until 2022) for all clinical questions, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted for studies related to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from 2 to 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published before 9 January 2024 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.

References were also made to other guidelines on ED as listed below:

- American Urological Association (AUA) - Erectile Dysfunction: AUA Guideline (2018)
- European  Association  of  Urology  (EAU)  -  EAU  Guidelines  on Sexual and Reproductive Health (2023)

A  total  of  12  main  clinical  questions  were  developed  under  different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions . The DG members met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the findings of  systematic  reviews/meta-analyses  and  clinical  trials,  with  local practices taken into consideration.

The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the U. S. Preventive  Services  Task  Force  Level  of  Evidence  (2015)  while  the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE as much as possible (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG followed  strictly  the  requirement  of Appraisal  of  Guidelines  for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II.

Upon completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA)  and  CPG  Council,  MoH  Malaysia,  for  review  and  approval. Details on the CPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from the Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at https:// www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG\_MANUAL\_MAHTAS.pdf).

Management of Erectile Dysfunction

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  is  a  prevalent  and  multifaceted  medical condition characterised by the persistent inability to achieve  or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. As a widespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life of affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress, strained relationships and diminished overall well-being. 1, level III

ED  can  manifest  in  various  forms  which  can  be  due  to  organic, psychogenic and mixed aetiologies. 2 Organic ED may result from  vascular,  neurogenic,  hormonal  or  anatomical  factors,  while psychogenic ED is often associated with psychosocial issues. Mixed ED involves a combination of both organic and psychogenic factors, making  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  condition  crucial  for effective management.

The  pathophysiology  of  ED  is  complex,  involving  intricate  interplay between  vascular,  neurologic,  hormonal  and  psychological  factors. Vascular  insufficiency,  endothelial  dysfunction  and  altered  smooth muscle tone are common contributors. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for tailoring therapeutic interventions to the specific needs of the patient.

In 1995, approximately 150 million men worldwide were estimated to be affected by ED and this is likely to double by 2025. 3, level III  Throughout Asia, there is variation in the prevalence rate of ED ranging between 2.0% and 81.8%. 4, level III  A local study at five government primary care clinics in Petaling District showed that the prevalence of ED for males aged 40 to 79 years old was 69.5%. It increased with age from 49.7% of men in their 40s to 66.5%, 92.8% and 93.9% of men in their 50s, 60s and 70s respectively. 5, level III  A recent study based on National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019 data revealed a prevalence of moderate to  severe  ED  in  men  aged  ≥18  years  at  31.6%  (95%  CI  28.8  to 34.6). 6, level III

The burden of ED extends beyond its physical manifestations, impacting the mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is associated with co-  morbidities  e.g.  diabetes  mellitus  (DM),  cardiovascular  diseases (CVDs) and depression. Moreover, ED is known to be an early marker of systemic vascular dysfunction, emphasising the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention. 2

Clinical  practices  for  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  ED  can  vary significantly,  reflecting  differences  in  healthcare  systems,  cultural perceptions  and  access  to  resources.  Recognising  and  addressing these variations is crucial to ensure equitable and effective care for the affected individuals.

In conclusion, this CPG on Management of ED endeavours to provide a  systematic  and  culturally  sensitive  approach  to  the  diagnosis  and treatment  of  ED.  It  is  hoped  that  this  CPG  can  help  in  optimising resource  utilisation  by  providing  evidence-based  recommendations for efficient and safe management of ED. Eventually, this will lead to standardised care, improved patient outcomes and reduced the burden of ED on affected individuals, their partners and the healthcare system.

## 2. RISK FACTORS

There  are  various  risk  factors  associated  with  ED  e.g.  age,  lifestyle behaviours, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, psychological and hormonal risks. A person may have more than one risk factor at a time.

## 2.1 Age

In a local study on moderate to severe ED, all age groups of patients above 18 years old and sexually active were substantially affected by the condition. The prevalence was 32.7% in those 18 - 30 years old, 26.3% in 31 - 59 years old and 64.1% in ≥60 years old. Men aged ≥60 years were strongly associated with moderate-to-severe ED with an OR of 3.04 (95% CI 2.27 to 4.10). 6, level III

## 2.2 Lifestyle behaviours

## a) Diet

In  a  meta-analysis  on  behaviour  factors  (including  diet)  in  ED,  fruit and  vegetable  consumption  revealed  mixed  results  on  the  risk  of ED.  Meanwhile,  increased  consumption  of  flavonoids  reduced  the risk. 7, level II-2

A prospective cohort study on the association between the Mediterranean diet and ED reported highest category of Mediterranean Diet Score was inversely associated with incidence of ED in those aged &lt;60 years (HR=0.78 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92) and 60 - 70 years (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.89). 8, level II-2

## b)  Physical activity

In  males  aged  ≥20  years,  a  cross-sectional  study  showed  physical activity of at least moderate intensity was associated with lower odds of ED compared with no physical activity in a week as demonstrated below: 9, level III

- 1 - 2 days/week (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.76)
- 3 - 4 days/week (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75)
- 5 - 7 days/week (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.64)

The benefits of physical activity was shown in another cross-sectional study on diabetic patients where higher activity was inversely associated with moderate-to-severe ED and severe ED (OR=0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.85 and OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.73 respectively). 10, level III

A  cross-sectional  study  showed  that  higher  cardiovascular  (CV) exercise levels (based on weekly metabolic equivalents time [MET]-hours)  in  physically  active  men  were  inversely  associated with  ED  based  on  self-reported  data  of  the  respondents  (p  for trend=0.03). 11, level III

However, a meta-analysis of five cross-sectional studies showed that cyclists  had  higher  odds  of  having  ED  compared  with  non-cyclists (OR=2.00, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.55). Quality assessment showed that the primary studies were of fair to poor quality. 12, level III

## c)  Obesity

A cross-sectional study in an andrology clinic showed that obese men (body mass index [BMI] ≥29 kg/m2) had a higher risk of ED (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90) compared with those non-obese. 13, level III

## d)  Smoking

A  cross-sectional  study  among  men  showed  that  cigarette  smoking was an independent risk factor for ED (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81). A dose-response was also exhibited (p =0.005). 14, level III

## e)  Alcohol

In a meta-analysis of 24 cross-sectional studies, alcohol consumption was  not  associated  with  ED.  Further  analysis  showed  that  when compared with non-drinkers, light to moderate consumption exhibited a beneficial effect on the risk of ED (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86) whereas  high  consumption  did  not.  Heterogeneity  in  the  analysis was significant. 15, level III  There was no report on quality assessment of primary papers.

## f) Recreational drugs

A  systematic  review  of  behaviour  factors  in  relation  to  ED  showed that  users  of  recreational  drugs  (amphetamine,  cannabis,  opioid and  ecstasy)  had  an  increased  risk  of  ED  compared  with  non-user. According to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the primary papers scored moderate to high quality. 7, level II-2

## g)  Pornography

A  cross-sectional  study  on  the  association  between  problematic pornography consumption and ED using an internet-based questionnaire showed higher cyber pornography addiction test scores resulted in a higher probability of ED by 1.06 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.08). 16, level III

In another cross-sectional study, the analysis demonstrated that men who preferred masturbation with pornography vs partnered sex without pornography were at a significantly increased risk of having ED. 17, level III

## h)  Partner's sexual dysfunction

A meta-analysis was conducted to assess evidence on female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and its impact on male partners. The findings based on six cross-sectional studies revealed that the likelihood of ED is almost four times higher when the female partner had FSD compared with men who have partners without FSD (OR=3.80, 95% CI 1.96 to 7.38). Based

on McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies, the risk of bias for the primary studies were scored 82 - 100%. 18, level III

## 2.3 Co-morbidities

## a) Diabetes mellitus

In a large meta-analysis on the prevalence of ED, the overall prevalence among diabetic patients was 59.1% (95% CI 55.5 to 62.7) while the odds of prevalence in diabetic patients vs healthy controls was 3.62 (95% CI 2.53 to 5.16). 19, level III

## b)  Hypertension

In a meta-analysis of eight high-quality cross-sectional studies, hypertension was a risk factor for ED based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.00). However, the heterogeneity of primary studies was high. 20, level III

## c)  Cardiovascular diseases

A local cross-sectional study reported a prevalence of various severity ED among patients with established ischaemic heart disease (IHD) at 90.4%. The mean age of patients was 60.5±9.58 years with two-thirds of them having moderate to severe ED. 21, level III

In another cross-sectional study, the prevalence of ED among patients with  post-myocardial  infarction  (MI)  was  62%.  Arterial  hypertension (CVD risk) was significantly associated with ED. 22, level III

## d)  End-stage renal disease

In a meta-analysis on the prevalence of ED in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the overall pooled prevalence was 71% (95% CI 67 to 74%). Further subgroup analyses showed that pooled prevalence among patients with ESRD pre-dialysis (82%) was the highest compared with those who were on haemodialysis (79%), peritoneal dialysis (71%) and renal transplant recipients (59%). 23, level II-2

## e)  Hyperuricaemia

A meta-analysis demonstrated an association between hyperuricaemia and risk of ED based on study design i.e.: 24, level II-2

- five cohort studies (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.89)
- six cross-sectional studies (OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.65)

The  same  meta-analysis  of  three  cohort  studies  also  reported  that urate- lowering therapy reduced the risk among hyperuricaemic patients (OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.41).

## f) Obstructive sleep apnoea

A systematic review of observational studies assessed the association between  obstructive  sleep  apnoea  (OSA)  and  ED.  It  reported  the

prevalence of ED among patients with OSA ranged from 40.9 to 80%. There were mixed findings on the association between risk of ED and OSA severity (using Apnea-Hypopnea Index), oxygen saturation &lt;90% during sleep or waketime sleepiness. 25, level II-2

## g)  Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome

In  a  meta-analysis,  a  subgroup  analysis  based  on  observational studies  showed  chronic  prostatitis/chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome  had a higher risk of ED compared with controls (OR=2.68, 95% CI 2.23 to 3.22). 26, level II-2

## h)  Depression and anxiety

In  a  meta-analysis  of  three  cohort  studies,  the  odds  of  having  ED among depressed patients was 2.55 (95% CI 2.12 to 3.06) compared with non-depressed patients. 27, level II-2

A  systematic  review  of  anxiety  disorders  found  that  the  median prevalence  of  ED  was  20.0%  (IQR  5.1  to  41.2)  based  on  IIEF-5, International  Classification  of  Diseases,  Ninth  Revision  (ICD-9)  and Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  4th  Edition (DSM-IV)  criteria  and  17.6%  (IQR  13.88  to  20.88)  based  on  IIEF-5 alone. 28, level III

## i) Hypogonadism

In a cross-sectional study assessing the adverse health outcomes of testicular  cancer  survivors  post-chemotherapy, those with secondary hypogonadism  reported  a  higher  risk  of  ED  compared  with  those without the condition (19.6% vs 11.9%, p=0.018). 29, level III

## j) Traumatic brain injuries

A cohort study on the association of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and ED showed: 30, level II-2

- incidence rate of ED was higher in the TBI group compared with the non-TBI group (24.66 per 100,000 vs 19.07 per 100,000) after a 10-year follow-up
- higher risk of ED for the TBI group after adjustment of confounding factors (HR=2.569, 95% CI 1.890 to 3.492)
- higher severity of TBI increased the risk of ED (dose-dependent) -
-  mild (HR=2.305, 95% CI 1.672 to 3.124)
-  moderate (HR=2.551, 95% CI 1.884 to 3.331)
-  severe (HR=5.467, 95% CI 2.452 to 7.706)

## 2.4 Medications

## a)  Antihypertensives

Thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers (β-blockers) are usually associated with drug-induced ED. 2

However, a network meta-analysis showed NS difference in erectile  function  (EF)  based  on  pairwise  comparisons  of  all  major antihypertensive  classes  (angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, calcium channel blocker and thiazide diuretics) and also with placebo. Further analysis of different β-blockers on EF demonstrated that: 31, level I

- nebivolol  had  beneficial  effect  compared  with  non-vasodilatory β-blockers (OR=2.92, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.5)
- NS difference between carvedilol and non-vasodilatory β-blockers

## b)  Statins

In a meta-analysis that consisted of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on patients with established CVD or CVD risk factors, there was no association found between statins and the incidence of ED. 32, level I

## c) Finasteride

A  meta-analysis  of  nine  RCTs  on  androgenetic  alopecia  showed  an increased  risk  of  ED  compared  with  placebo  among  patients  who were on finasteride 1 mg/day (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.60) but no association with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day. 33, level I

A more recent meta-analysis showed that based on the safety profile, there  was  an  NS  difference  in  the  risk  of  developing  ED  between finasteride and dutasteride. 34, level I

Treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) includes 5-α-reductase inhibitors  which  are  among  the  associated  risk  factors  for  druginduced ED. 2

## d)  Psychotropic agents

A  large  retrospective  cohort  study  demonstrated  that  males  with serotogenic  antidepressants  were  associated  with  increased  risk  for ED compared with those without serotogenic antidepressants (OR=3.2, 95% CI 2.3 to 4.4). 35, level II-2

Antidepressants  (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors  and tricyclics)  and  antipsychotics  are  among  the  risk  factors  for  druginduced ED. 2

## 3. DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT

Assessment and diagnosis of ED should always begin with a detailed medical,  sexual  and  psychological  history  of  the  patients  and,  when available, their partners. The history should include information about past  and  current  sexual  relationships,  previous  consultations  and treatments.

## 3.1 Medical History, Physical Examination and Laboratory Testing

## a) History

A detailed history aided by validated questionnaires, e.g. the 15-item version  of  IIEF  (IIEF-15),  or  its  short  version  IIEF-5, 36,  level  III help  to assess the different  sexual  function  domains  (i.e.  sexual  desire,  EF, orgasmic  function,  intercourse  satisfaction  and  overall  satisfaction), as well as the potential impact of a specific treatment modality. In a systematic review on the IIEF-15 and IIEF-5 measurement properties, both had comparable sensitivity and specificity at different cut-off points in evaluating ED. 37, level III

Assessment of penile rigidity in practice and research can be supported by the use of the Erectile Hardness Score (EHS). A validation study of EHS showed that it had a fairly good correlation with IIEF in all domains (ranging between 0.63 to 0.86) except the sexual desire domain. 38, level III

The assessment of IIEF-5 and EHS helps to determine severity of ED, hence guiding the physician in choosing the appropriate management.

Patients should always be screened  for symptoms  of  possible hypogonadism, including decreased energy and libido. Potential risk factors for ED e.g. DM (refer to Chapter 2 ) should be screened for and identified.

Refer  to Appendix 3 for Relevant  History-taking  in  Patients  with Symptoms of ED, Appendix 4 for 5-item  Version of International Index  of  Erectile  Function  (IIEF-5) and Appendix  5 for Erection Hardness Score .

## b)  Physical examination

Patients should undergo physical examination focusing on the genitourinary (including prostate), endocrine, vascular and neurological systems. Blood pressure, heart rate and BMI or waist circumference should be measured during clinical examination as part of cardiovascular risk assessment.

A physical examination may reveal penile abnormalities, e.g. Peyronie's disease, pre-malignant or malignant genital lesions, prostatic enlargement and signs suggestive of hypogonadism (e.g. small testes or alterations in secondary sexual characteristics). 2

## c) Laboratory testing

Laboratory testing must be tailored to the patient's symptoms and risk factors. The tests are performed to identify and treat any modifiable risk factors. Fasting blood glucose or haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) and lipid profile should be performed as part of the CV risk assessment. 2

Additional laboratory tests may be considered on a case-to-case basis e.g. hormonal tests which include early morning total testosterone, total prostate- specific antigen (PSA), prolactin and luteinizing hormone. 2

## d)  Advanced work-up

Most patients with ED can be managed based on their medical and sexual history; conversely, some patients may need specific diagnostic tests as discussed below.

## i. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity test

The nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) device has to be worn by the patient overnight for at least two separate nights and gives the following information:

- number of erectile episodes
- tumescence (circumference change by strain gauges)
- maximal penile rigidity
- duration of nocturnal erections

An erectile event lasting ≥10 minutes and with at least 60% stiffness observed on the tip of the penis is indicative  of  a  functional  erectile mechanism. NPTR monitoring can help to differentiate between organic and psychogenic ED objectively; patients with psychogenic ED usually have normal findings. However, its routine use in the diagnosis of ED may be limited due to potential confounding factors (e.g. dreams) which may affect nocturnal erection. 2

## ii. Intracavernous injection test

The intracavernous injection test is performed with or without dynamic duplex  Doppler  ultrasound.  The  ultrasonography  can  help  confirm potential vasculogenic aetiology of ED. Peak systolic blood flow &gt;30 cm/s,  end-diastolic  velocity  &lt;3  cm/s  and  resistance  index  &gt;0.8  are considered normal. 2

## iii.  Arteriography

Patients who are being considered for penile revascularisation should have penile pudendal arteriography. For patients with ED and isolated penile artery stenosis, computed tomography angiography is advocated prior to penile artery angioplasty. 2

The specific diagnostic tests for ED listed above are indicated for the following conditions: 2

- primary ED (not caused by acquired organic disease or psychogenic disorder)
- young patients with a history of pelvic or perineal trauma suspected to have vasculogenic ED
- patients with penile deformities that might require surgical correction (e.g. Peyronie's disease and congenital penile curvature)
- patients with complex endocrine disorders
- patients with complex psychiatric or psychosexual disorders
- medico-legal reasons [e.g. implantation of penile prosthesis (PP) to document end-stage ED and sexual abuse]

## 3.2 Cardiovascular Risk Assessment

- ED  could  be  the  initial  manifestation  of  a  spectrum  of  clinical conditions that eventually lead to coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease.
- The prevalence of ED is &gt;70% among men with CVD. 39, level III

A cohort study on patients with ED showed: 40, level II-2

- severe ED predicted major adverse cardiac event (MACE) with HR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.78)
- lower penile blood flow before and after prostaglandin-E1 stimulation was associated with an increased risk of MACE -
-  in  flaccid  conditions  (peak  systolic  velocity  [PSV]  &lt;13  cm/s), the HR was 2.67 (95% CI 1.42 to 5.04)
-  in dynamic conditions (PSV &lt;25 cm/s), the HR was 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.47)

A meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that ED was associated with risk of: 41, level II-2

- coronary heart disease (RR=1.46, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.63)
- stroke (RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.54)
- all-cause mortality (RR=1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34)

The above analysis showed NS heterogeneity. However, there was no report on the quality assessment of primary studies.

A  cross-sectional  study  on  three  different  CV  risk  engines  among patients referred for sexual dysfunction showed that the AUC was 0.762, 0.716  and  0.667  for  Progetto  Cuore,  Framingham  and  Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) engines respectively. 42, level III

Patients  with  predominantly  vasculogenic  ED  are  suggested  to  be assessed using 2019  American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk score based on recommendation  by  Princeton  IV  consensus  guidelines.  It  provides estimation of patients with major CV events within the next 10 years and can be accessed online via https://tools.acc.org/ascvd-risk-estimatorplus/#!/calculate/estimate/. Depending on ASCVD score, patients may require for further cardiologist assessment. 43

European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines 2023 categorise the cardiac  risk  stratification  among  patients  with  ED  based  on  the  2nd and 3rd Princeton Consensus. The characteristics and management for each risk are as follows ( Table 1 ). 2; 44

Table 1: Cardiac risk stratification for patients with ED based on 2nd and 3rd Princeton Consensus

CAD  =  coronary  artery  disease;  CHF  =  congestive  heart  failure;  ED  =  erectile dysfunction; LVD = left ventricular dysfunction; MI = myocardial infarction; NYHA = New York Heart Association

*Risk factors for CAD include high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, DM, smoking and/or second-hand smoke exposure, obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. 45, level III

## 3.3 Psychological and Sexual Assessment

Psychosocial and sexual history is important for thorough and comprehensive assessment. These can be assessed through clinical interviews  and  objective  measurements  on  specific  areas  of  history which include: 2; 46

- current psychological state and co-morbid psychiatry conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression)
- relationship  history  -  issues,  dynamics,  durations  and  partner history
- partner's sexual functioning (e.g. FSD)
- life stressors and coping abilities
- cognitive factors -
-  dysfunctional thinking style
-  expectations on sexuality and sexual performance, and treatment preferences
- sexual related factors -
-  education
-  trauma
-  experience (e.g. masturbation, pornography usage)
-  cultural and religious aspects
-  gender dysphoria and sexual orientation
- co-morbid sexual dysfunction (e.g. premature ejaculation)

## 4. TREATMENT

ED  can  be  treated  with  multiple  therapeutic  options.  These  include lifestyle  modifications,  pharmacological  agents,  mechanical  devices, surgeries  and  psychological  interventions.  It  should  be  a  dynamic process resulting in a patient-centred treatment strategy that depends on the effectiveness, safety and cost of the treatment. In this context, shared decision-making (preferably with a partner) is essential throughout the management of ED.

## 4.1 Lifestyle Intervention

ED is strongly associated with lifestyle risk factors. Addressing these factors is important in the treatment of ED.

A  systematic  review  of  patients  with  ED  ±  treatment  of  ED  showed that  modifications  of  CV  risk  factors  which  included  physical  activity, Mediterranean diet and weight loss improved IIEF-5 score compared with those not receiving the interventions (MD=2.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.61).  Overall,  the  studies  had  moderate  to  good  methodological quality. 47, level I

Another  systematic  review  of  10  clinical  trials  demonstrated  that aerobic exercise of moderate-vigorous intensity (≥3 times/week for ≥30 minutes/ session) improved IIEF or IIEF-5 for men with arterial ED due to physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and/or CVD compared with controls. In general, the risk of bias for each study was estimated to be moderate. 48, level I

Weight  loss  regimen  which  included  low-energy  diet  and  physical exercises among overweight or obese man improved erectile function (MD of IIEF score=1.99, 95% 0.85 to 3.13) based on a meta-analysis of five moderate-to-high quality RCTs. 49, level I  In relation to weight loss, a pre-post study on ED patients with obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m 2  or ≥35 kg/m 2 with other co-morbidities), bariatric surgery significantly improved their erectile function based on IIEF scores. 50, level II-3

The male pelvic floor muscles have three major functions i.e. to support the abdominal content, coordinate contraction with sphincters for faeces and  urine  elimination,  and  to  facilitate  the  erection  and  ejaculatory processes. A systematic review among patients with ED on pelvic floor muscle training under therapist supervision in 5 - 20 sessions for 3 4 months showed 35 - 47% of cure in ED from baseline. The mean methodological quality of the trials was 70% based on Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool score. 51, level II-3

Another pre-post study on smoking cessation showed that quit smoking significantly  improved  ED  irrespective  of  pack-years  of  smoking  and severity of ED. 52, level II-3

In  a  recent  pre-post  study  on  patients  with  alcohol  use  disorder  and ED,  IIEF-5  scores  improved  after  three  months  of  abstinence  from alcohol (p&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age, alcoholic liver disease and number of standard drinks per day were associated with the improvement of ED. 53, level II-2

A cross-sectional study found significantly higher perceived stress in patients  with  ED  than  healthy  controls. 54,  level  III   In  managing  stress, counselling is helpful as an initial step to provide support and guidance regarding ED.

Psychotherapy, on the other hand, goes one step further and is directed towards  gaining  insights  into  chronic  and  recurrent  emotional  and cognitive patterns, and their contribution to ED (refer to Subchapter 4.5 ). 55, level III

EAU Guidelines 2023 recommends to modify risk factors and commence lifestyle changes prior to or concurrently with ED treatments. 2

## Recommendation 2

- All patients with erectile dysfunction should be advised on lifestyle and risk factor modifications.

## 4.2 Pharmacological Treatment

The  main  pharmacological  agents  for  ED  are  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  (PDE5is).  These  agents  cause  corporeal  smooth  muscle relaxation, increased arterial blood flow and compression of sub-tunical venous plexus leading to erection. Therefore, they are contraindicated in patients taking nitric oxide (NO) donors, organic nitrates or organic nitrites  (e.g.  glyceryl  trinitrate). As  they  are  not  initiators  of  erection, PDE5is  require  environmental  and  psychological  cues  for  sufficient sexual arousal and stimulation to facilitate an erection. The U. S. Food and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)-approved  PDE5is  will  be  discussed below. Refer to Appendix 6 for Pharmacological Treatment in ED .

## a) Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor

## i. Sildenafil

Sildenafil was the first available PDE5i in the market. The recommended initial dose is 50 mg and may be adjusted according to its responses and adverse events (AEs). The onset is 30 - 60 minutes and the effect persists up to 12 hours after administration. 2

In  a  pre-post  study  on  ED  patients  with  DM  and/or  hypertension treated  with  flexible-dose  sildenafil  of  25  -  100  mg  on-demand/ once daily, the medication significantly improved mean IIEF-5 score  from  13.6±5.7  at  baseline  to  21.7±4.1  at  week  12.  Sildenafil was  generally  safe  and  well-tolerated.  The  most  common  reported AEs  were  headache  (5.5%),  flushing  (1.9%)  and  nasal  congestion (1.3%). 56, level II-3

A meta-analysis of RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of sildenafil compared with placebo in patients with DM-associated ED showed that sildenafil: 57, level I

- improved IIEF-5 Question 3 score (WMD=1.14, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.50) and IIEF-5 Question 4 (WMD=1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.42)
- increased overall sexual performance satisfaction based on global efficacy question (RR=3.99, 95% CI 2.58 to 6.18)
- led to more successful intercourse (RR=3.34, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.31) with higher number of patients reporting at least one successful attempt of intercourse in the last four weeks of treatment (RR=2.86, 95% CI 2.25 to 3.65)

The  most  common  AEs  reported  were  headache,  dyspepsia  and flushing. Overall, the risk of bias of the primary studies was moderate to high.

A large network meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of PDE5i in ED showed that sildenafil at low doses (25 or 50 mg) followed by tadalafil (10 or 20 mg) were the first therapeutic options for ED. 58, level I

## ii. Tadalafil

In a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/ BPH/ED, tadalafil 5 mg once daily was more effective than placebo in terms of: 59, level I

- IIEF score (SMD=5.18, 95% CI 4.13 to 6.23)
- Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP)2 score (OR=5.46, 95% CI 3.53 to 8.46)
- SEP3 score (OR= 4.14, 95% CI 3.11 to 5.50)

Tadalafil was well tolerated although the AEs were not specified. The primary papers were of low risk of bias.

Two meta-analyses compared the effectiveness and safety of tadalafil 5  -  10  mg  once-a-day  and  tadalafil  10  -  20  mg  on-demand  dosing regimen  in  ED  patients.  In  the  first  meta-analysis,  the  once-a-day regimen  improved  IIEF-EF  scores  compared  with  on-demand  at  12 weeks (WMD=1.82, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.80). A secondary sub-analysis on four RCTs showed that tadalafil 5 mg once-a-day was more effective in IIEF-EF than 20 mg on-demand at 12 weeks (WMD=1.51, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.53). 60, level I  However, the analysis showed NS differences in IIEFEF scores between the two regimens regardless of different end-point

of study duration. 60 - 61, level I  There was NS difference in AEs between both  groups. 61, level I   The  quality  of  RCTs  in  both  meta-analyses  was variable.

A  large  meta-analysis  of  RCTs  compared  the  effectiveness  and safety  of  tadalafil  vs  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  ED.  The  findings showed: 62, level I

- NS  differences  in  means  of  IIEF  (IIEF-EF,  IIEF-intercourse satisfaction, IIEF-overall satisfaction and IIEF-sexual desire)
- tadalafil  had  significantly  better  Self-Esteem  and  Relationship (SEAR)  Confidence,  SEAR  Sexual  Relationship  and  Erectile Dysfunction  Inventory  of  Treatment  Satisfaction  (EDITS)  total scores

Although  there  was  NS  difference  in  overall  AEs  between  the  two agents, tadalafil had significantly higher risk of myalgia and back pain, and lower risk of flushing. Most of the studies scored two on the Jadad score (low quality).

## iii.  Avanafil

Avanafil (100 mg and 200 mg) was compared with placebo in the metaanalysis of eight RCTs among patients with ED. It was more effective in terms of: 63, level I

- higher IIEF-EF score (MD=4.57, 95% CI 3.68 to 5.46)
- successful vaginal penetration (RR=3.20, 95% CI 2.60 to 3.95)
- successful intercourse (RR=2.53, 95% CI 2.19 to 2.92)

In a sub-group analysis, the 200 mg dose was significantly better than 100 mg in IIEF score and successful intercourse. For AEs, avanafil had a higher risk compared with placebo (RR=1.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.31). However, there was NS difference in AEs between the two doses of avanafil. The methodological quality of primary studies was generally high.

In  a  12-weeks,  multi-centre,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  RCT  of men with DM and ED, avanafil (100 and 200 mg) was more effective than placebo in improving IIEF score and successful intercourse which could be initiated in ≤15 minutes through &gt;6 hours. The most commonly reported AEs with avanafil were headache, nasopharyngitis, flushing and sinus congestion. 64, level I

## iv.  Vardenafil

The  effectiveness  of  vardenafil  vs  placebo  in  ED  was  studied  in  a meta-analysis of RCTs. The former was significantly more effective in IIEF-overall satisfaction, SEP2 and SEP3 scores. No safety profile was reported. The mean Jadad score was 3.54, indicating that all included studies were of high quality. 65, level I  However, vardenafil is not registered yet in Malaysia.

- Patients with ED should stop PDE5i and seek immediate medical care when there is a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). 66, level III
- However, patients with a history of NAION may be prescribed PDE5i with caution.

## Recommendation 3

- Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with erectile dysfunction unless contraindicated.
-  The choice of agent is individualised.

## b) Combination therapy vs monotherapy

A  meta-analysis  showed that the combination of PDE5i with various agents (mainly alpha-blocker, testosterone and antioxidants) was more effective than PDE5i monotherapy in the subgroup of patients that have ED (WMD in IIEF score=1.76, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.24). However, there was NS difference in treatment-related AEs. GRADE gave a moderate quality assessment of the outcomes. The heterogeneity of the primary papers was significant. 67, level I

On the treatment of ED, EAU Guidelines 2023 recommends PDE5is as a first- line therapeutic option for the specific condition. The choice of  drug  depends  on  the  frequency  of  intercourse  and  the  patient's personal experience. 2

## c)  Other medications

## · Intracavernosal injection

Intracavernosal  injections  (ICIs)  were  the  first  medical  treatment  for ED.  The  only  FDA-approved  preparation  is  alprostadil.  There  are many combination preparations that include either one or more of the following  combinations  of  phentolamine,  papaverine  or  atropine  but none have obtained FDA approval, making standardisation of dosing difficult. Apart from that, patients and their partners need to learn the injection technique under supervision by trained medical personnel.

In a cohort study of Korean ED patients who received ICI at least twice, adequate penile rigidity was restored in 60.2% of patients. AEs occurred in 25.5% of patients which were due to: 68, level II-2

- pain during self-injection (45.9%), longer erections than expected (23.0%), penile curvature (14.9%), palpable plaque (10.8%) and subcutaneous haematoma (5.4%) in the withdrawal group
- prolonged  erection  (44.4%)  as  the  most  common  AE  in  the continuing group

There was no incidence of injection site infection. Overall satisfaction was 40.1%.

In patients on anticoagulation, caution should be exercised when ICI is used. A cross-sectional study found that the rate of bleeding events was higher on patients with anticoagulation compared with those not on the medication although it was NS. 69, level III  However, the study may be underpowered.

Novel  intracavernosal  therapies  including  stem  cell  and  platelet-rich plasma have shown promising results but require more robust studies before they can be recommended. 2

## · Intraurethral alprostadil

For  patients  who  are  concerned  with  the  AEs  of  PDE5is  or  refuse ICIs, intraurethral alprostadil is an alternative. There are two methods of administration. The first method is the Medicated Urethral System for  Erection (MUSE) where a pellet of alprostadil is inserted into the urethra. A recent method uses topical cream that can be applied into the urethra meatus or onto the glans penis.

In a systematic review, five RCTs showed significant improvement in erection which was sufficient for intercourse in MUSE compared with placebo.  However,  MUSE  was  shown  to  be  inferior  to  ICIs.  In  one of  the  RCTs  on  patients  post-bilateral  nerve  sparing  prostatectomy, MUSE  was  comparable  to  sildenafil  in  effectiveness  but  had  lower compliance. 70, level I  There was no mention on quality assessment of the primary papers.

In a multi-centre pre-post study on ED, 74% of patients demonstrated overall improvement in EF with topical alprostadil. About 12% of patients discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  hypo-/hyper-responsiveness  while &lt;5% did so because of AEs. 71, level II-3

The most common AEs with topical alprostadil are local pain (29 - 41%) and  dizziness  with  possible  hypotension  (1.9  -  14%).  Penile  fibrosis and priapism are rare (&lt;1%). Urethral bleeding (5%) and urinary tract infections (0.2%) may occur if it is administered into the urethra. 2

- ICI and intraurethral alprostadil are options in the treatment of ED. However, both are not available locally yet.

## 4.3 Mechanical Treatment

In  the  landscape  of  evolving  treatment  options  for  ED,  mechanical devices have been used with success and safe to maintain an erection as  discussed  below. The  common  mechanical  devices  available  are vacuum  erection  devices  (VEDs)  and  low-intensity  extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT). Refer to Appendix 6 for M echanical Treatment in ED .

## a)  Vacuum erection device

A  pre-post  study  to  investigate  satisfaction  with  VED  for  middleaged  and  older  male  veterans  with  ED  and  their  female  partners showed: 72, level II-3

- majority of patients achieved favourable outcomes i.e. -
-  96.0% reported the ability to maintain an erection and 90.7% were able to engage with intercourse; however, the older age group (&gt;65 years) was associated with significant difficulty in obtaining erections and engaging in sexual intercourse
-  92.0% had improved intercourse
-  93.9%  mentioned  that  their  sexual  relationship  with  partner was satisfactory or very satisfactory
- 83.8% of female partners rated sex as better
- 23%  of  patients  reported  physical  discomfort  (e.g.  difficulties placing  the  bands  on  the  cylinder,  sliding  them  on  the  penis, removing them after sex or pain)
- 9.1%  reported  having  psychological  discomfort  (e.g.  frustration and lack of spontaneity)

In an RCT of men with type 2 DM and ED treated with either combination of sildenafil 100 mg and VED and sildenafil 100 mg alone, the former showed: 73, level I

- significantly  higher  IIEF  scores  at  one  month  (14.86±2.17  vs 12.41±2.63) and three months (17.53±2.95 vs 14.29±2.81)
- significantly  higher  rates  of  successful  penetration  (73.3%  vs 46.6%)  and  successful  intercourse  (70.0%  vs  46.6%)  at  three months

The AEs (e.g. penile bruising and numbness for VED) were mostly mild and did not affect the patients' daily life.

Refer  to Appendix  7 for Application  of  Vacuum  Erectile  Device (VED) .

## b)  Shockwave therapy

An RCT showed that Li-ESWT improved the erectile function of young patients  with  vasculogenic  mild  ED  compared  with  placebo.  The findings showed that Li-ESWT increased the mean IIEF-EF scores at three  months  follow-up  (p=0.003)  apart  from  successful  penetration

(SEP2) and intercourse (SEP3) in &gt;50% of attempts (p=0.001). 74, level I There were limitations in the methodological quality of this RCT.

Two pre-post studies on moderate ED showed that Li-ESWT significantly improved EF post-treatment. 75 - 76, level II-3   It  was also found to be safe as patients reported no irritative urinary symptoms and intracutaneous activity after undergoing the treatment. 75, level II-3

A local technology review on the effectiveness and safety of Li-ESWT among patients with ED showed that the intervention: 77, level I

- was mostly benefited in younger men with mild to moderate ED and those with fewer co-morbidities
- was effective from three to six months
- enhanced the medication responses in PDE5i non-responders
- when used with adjuvant daily therapy, increased its effectiveness and duration of effect
- was also safe and well tolerated with modest improvement

The treatment was recommended to be performed only by the urologists. This  is  because  they  are  involved  in  the  entire  holistic  management of the patients and understand the mechanisms of action to tailor the treatment plan.

Refer to Appendix 8 for Low-intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy .

## Recommendation 4

- Mechanical devices (e.g. using vacuum erection device or shockwave therapy) may be offered in erectile dysfunction (ED).
- Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by urologists for mild to moderate ED.

## 4.4 Surgical Intervention

Surgical  interventions  in  ED  include  penile  revascularisation  surgery and PP.

## a) Penile revascularisation surgery

Vascular  ED  can  be  subcategorised  as  arterial  insufficiency  (AI), veno-occlusive  disease  (VOD)  or  mixed,  with  VOD  being  the  most common finding. Generally, the affected patients tend to develop ED at a younger age and may have a history of preceding trauma. Penile revascularisation is usually done in a very specialised centre outside of Malaysia.

## · Arterial insufficiency

AI occurs when there is inadequate arterial blood to the penis at the time of erection and may result if the artery cannot dilate appropriately after neurochemical signalling or if the upstream vascular flow is restricted.

Consensus  guidelines  by  the  International  Consultation  on  Sexual Medicine (ICSM) recommend that men with ED who satisfy the criteria of  the  index  patient  (&lt;55  years  with  recently  acquired ED from focal arterial  occlusive  disease  in  the  absence  of  other  risk  factors  e.g. smoking, DM) can be considered for penile revascularisation procedures (microsurgery or endovascular intervention). However, current data do not support one procedure over another in terms of effectiveness. 78

Short-  and  long-term  complications  of  microsurgery  include  wound infection (2.8%), urinary tract infection (2.6%), inguinal hernias (2.8%), sepsis (3.5%), wound haematoma (7.8 - 25%), loss of penile length (28%),  decreased  penile  sensitivity  (24.7%)  and  glans  hyperaemia (4 - 21%). 78

Potential complications of endovascular treatment (balloon angioplasty with  or  without  stent  insertion)  include  vascular  injury,  puncture  site aneurysm, infection, contrast-induced nephropathy. ICSM consensus guidelines reports NS AEs. 78

## · Veno-occlusive disease

VOD occurs when an erection cannot be achieved or maintained despite an adequate arterial supply. It is most likely results from endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction leading to inadequate sinusoidal expansion and insufficient closure of emissary veins.

Both consensus guidelines of ICSM and EAU Guidelines 2023 do not recommend venous surgery or embolisation for VOD. 2; 78

- Vascular ED should be suspected in patients with ED at a younger age with the absence of other risk factors.

## b)  Penile prosthesis

In Malaysia, PP is usually used when other treatment modalities have failed. There are several types including malleable, 2-piece inflatable and 3-piece inflatable systems.

In a pre-post study of ED patients with failure of medical treatment who received inflatable PP, overall patients' and partners' satisfaction was 85% and 76% respectively. 79, level II-3

A meta-analysis with low-to-moderate risk of bias of primary studies on men with ED of any aetiology showed that 52.9% inflatable PP device survived at 20 years. 80, level II-3

Main AEs include mechanical failure (&lt;5% in five years) and infection (2  -  3%  in  low-risk  patients).  High-risk  patients  include  patients undergoing revision surgery, those with impaired host defences (e.g. immunosuppression, DM or spinal cord injury [SCI]) or those with penile corporal fibrosis. Other AEs include implant erosion (1 - 6%) as well as glans ischaemia and necrosis. 2

Refer to Appendix 9 for Examples of Penile Prosthesis .

## Recommendation 5

- Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with erectile dysfunction who have failed other interventions.

## 4.5 Psychological Intervention

Psychosocial intervention plays a vital role in ED treatment because both  psychological  and  social  factors  predispose  and  perpetuate erectile  problems.  It  is  recommended  to  involve  the  partner  in  this management of ED as it  may help to identify sexual difficulties among the partners. 18,  level  III;  55,  level  III   The  main  components  of  psychosocial treatment  of  ED  include  psychoeducation,  cognitive  and  behavioural techniques, aimed  at  reducing  anxiety, challenging dysfunctional beliefs, increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance and, increasing  intimacy  and  communication  skills  in  a  relational  context. Sex therapy is a specific type of psychotherapy, focusing specifically on sexual experiences. 55, level III

In a Cochrane systematic review on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of ED, the findings were: 81, level I

- focused  sex-group  therapy  was  more  effective  in  reducing  the persistence of ED than control (no treatment) (RR=0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.43)
- group  therapy  with  sildenafil  showed  increased  reduction  of persistent ED compared with sildenafil alone (RR=0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88)
- NS difference in effectiveness between psychosocial interventions vs local injection and vacuum devices

However,  there  were  limitations  in  the  methodological  quality  of  the primary studies.

The above findings were supported by a later meta-analysis. 82, level I

Another  meta-analysis  of  RCTs  looked  into  the  effectiveness  of  the following comparisons in the treatment of ED: 83, level I

- a specific psychological intervention vs wait-list
- two specific psychological interventions against each other
- a  combination  of  psychological  treatment  and  medication  vs medication only

The psychological interventions included sex therapy, marital therapy, educational  intervention  and  other  psychotherapies.  The  findings revealed moderate improvement in the symptom severity and sexual satisfaction  of  ED  participants,  however  it  was  not  significant. 83,  level  I The primary studies were of low-to-moderate quality.

A meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of psychological interventions alone, PDE5i  alone and their combination in the treatment of ED. The psychological intervention comprised of counselling,  sex  therapy,  cognitive-behavioural  sex  therapy  (CBST) and psychoeducation, delivered on an individual basis, with couples, in  group  settings  or  via  the  internet.  The  analysis  was  reported  as below. 84, level I

- Combined treatment had a superior effect on ED symptoms than PDE5i or psychological intervention alone (Cohen's d=0.45, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.89).
- There  were  NS  differences  between  psychological  intervention alone and PDE5is alone with respect to impact on ED symptoms.
- The effectiveness of the combined treatment remained consistent, regardless of the level of intensity in the psychological intervention.

However, the quality of the primary studies was low.

An umbrella review of meta-analyses on ED also supported the finding that combined treatment of PDE5i and psychological intervention was more effective than PDE5i alone (RR=2.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.92). Other findings were: 85, level I

- group psychotherapy was superior to wait-list (RR=2.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.72)
- non-pharmacological treatments rarely reported any AEs

Based on GRADE, the quality of primary studies was very low.

In a recent systematic review of RCTs comparing the effectiveness of PDE5i alone, psychological intervention alone or a combination of both interventions in psychogenic ED, the combined interventions were more effective than the monotherapies in erectile function which was mainly based  on  IIEF  scores.  Examples  of  the  psychological  interventions assessed  in  the  review  were  individual  cognitive  behaviour  therapy (CBT)/CBST, group therapy and counselling and, couple CBST. 86, level I

Qualitative  findings  in  a  mixed  method  study  among  patients  with situational  ED  who  received  mindfulness-based  group  treatment

consisting  of  daily  home-practice  activities  and,  integrated  elements of  psychoeducation, sex therapy and mindfulness skills showed that patients: 87, level II-3

- perceived  the  group  treatment  as  safe  and  supportive,  and validated  their  own  experience  which  led  to  a  reduction  of stigmatisation for male sexual dysfunction
- were able to identify and reduce their performance anxiety
- reported improvements in self-efficacy and acceptance regarding their conditions
- had  better  insights  into  the  significance  of  communicating  and gaining support from their partners

A  meta-analysis  which  included  four  RCTs  on  ED  and  one  on  both ED and premature ejaculation compared internet- and mobile-based psychological interventions (IMIs) with control. IMIs were more effective  but  with  small  effect  sizes  (Hedge's  g=0.18)  in  improving sexual  functioning  in  men.  All  IMIs  were  based  on  the  principle  of CBT  together  with  elements  of  sexual  therapy  including  treatment components  e.g.  psychosexual  education,  cognitive  restructuring, sensate focus, communication, etc. Based on Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool by the Cochrane Collaboration, all five RCTs have some concerns risk of bias. 88, level I

## Recommendation 6

- An integrated and collaborative approach with psychological interventions  should  be  considered  in  the  treatment  of  erectile dysfunction.

## 5. TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE

Traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) has been used for the prevention and treatment of ED for many years. The mechanisms of action remain unclear and warrant further clinical investigations.

A meta-analysis on nine RCTs comparing combination therapy of PDE5i and antioxidants (e.g. propionyl-L-carnitine or L-arginine) with PDE5i monotherapy in patients mainly with ED showed that the combination therapy was more effective based on IIEF score (WMD=1.99, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.63) without increasing AEs. The nine RCTs were mainly of low-risk of bias category. 67, level I

A systematic review assessed various TCMs in the management of ED. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs demonstrated the effectiveness of red ginseng in the treatment of ED compared with placebo in: 89, level I

- response rate (based on IIEF score) with RR of 2.40 (95% CI 1.65 to 3.51)
- psychogenic ED (based on global efficacy question) with RR of 2.05 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.16)
- sexual function (based on IIEF and Watts sexual function score) with SMD of 0.79 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.12)

However,  the  methodological  quality  of  the  included  RCTs  was averagely low.

Apart from the above, the other findings of the review were: 89, level I

- yohimbine  was  a  reasonable  therapeutic  option  compared  with placebo and, had infrequent and reversible AEs
- acupuncture  was  inconclusive  in  ED  treatment  due  to  scarce evidence
- There  is  insufficient  evidence  to  recommend  the  use  of  TCM including Tongkat Ali in the treatment of ED.

## 6. FOLLOW-UP

The follow-up for a patient with ED depends on the individual case and the initial treatment plan. Generally: 2; 90, level III

- short-term follow-up -

For  patients  initiating  treatment  with  oral  medications,  a  short-term follow-up within a few weeks to a couple of months may be appropriate to assess response and tolerance to the medication.

- long-term follow-up -

Once a treatment plan has been established, long-term follow-up may be scheduled at regular intervals. This allows for ongoing assessment of treatment effectiveness, potential adjustments to the treatment plan and monitoring for any emerging health issues.

- as needed follow-up -

For  patients  using  on-demand  treatments  or  lifestyle  modifications, follow-up may be scheduled on an as-needed basis, depending on their progress and any changes in their health status.

- referral back to primary care -

If  a  urologist has been involved in the initial evaluation and management, the urologist may refer the patient back to his primary care physician for ongoing follow-up if the ED is stable and well-managed.

It  is  important to note that these are specific follow-up plans and will vary  based  on  the  patient's  individual  circumstances  and  response to  treatment.  Regular  communication  and  collaboration  between  the primary care physician and the urologist, if involved, are key components of effective care for individuals with ED.

## 7. REFERRAL

Referring a patient with ED to a urologist or other relevant specialist is typically considered when/at:

- Primary care evaluation: The primary care physician has assessed the  patient,  taken  a  detailed  medical  history  and  performed  a physical examination. If the underlying cause of ED is not evident or if there  are concerns about specific urological issues, a referral may be appropriate.
- Treatment failure or complexity: If initial treatments, e.g. lifestyle changes,  oral  medications  (like  PDE5i)  or  other  conservative measures, do not yield satisfactory results or if a case is complex and may require specialised interventions (e.g. penile injections, VEDs or surgical options), a urologist may be consulted.
- Underlying  medical  conditions:  Presence  of  co-morbidities  that might  contribute  to  or  exacerbate  ED  e.g.  diabetes  mellitus, CVD, or hormonal disorders, consultation with a urologist and/or endocrinologist/cardiologist may be warranted.
- Psychological  factors:  If  psychological  factors  are  suspected  to be a significant contributor to the ED, collaboration with a mental health professional may be necessary. However, urologists may still play a role in addressing any physical aspects of the condition.

## 8. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

## 8.1 Patients with Cardiac Disease

Managing ED in patients with cardiac disease requires a comprehensive approach. Patients with atrial fibrillation showed an ED prevalence of 57% (95% CI 50 to 64) based on a meta-analysis. 91, level II-2

In  a  cohort  study  among  patients  attending  an  exercise  stress  test (EST) clinic,  it  was  found  that  patients  with  negative  EST  were  less likely  to  have  ED  compared  with  those  with  positive  EST  (OR=0.18, p&lt;0.001). 92, level II-2

Based on a large network meta-analysis on PDE5i and its doses in ED, sildenafil 50 mg was the most effective (84% probability in SUCRA) in improving IIEF scores when compared with placebo among patients with CV disorders. In terms of safety, vardenafil and udenafil had the best benefit-risk profiles in these studies. 58, level I Udenafil is not available locally yet.

In  addition,  a  pre-post  study  among  patients  with  ED  with  their  CV risk based on Framingham risk score showed that tadalafil 10 mg ondemand improved IIEF scores in all risk groups (p&lt;0.001). However, a  few  factors  were  associated  with  the  failure  of  tadalafil  to  achieve complete responsiveness i.e.: 93, level II-3

- increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level by every 1 mg/dL (OR=1.022, 95% CI 1.013 to 1.053)
- presence of hypertension (OR=2.217, 95% CI 1.015 to 2.987)
- higher Framingham score (OR=4.127, 95% CI 1.423 to 4.873)
- severe  ED  at  the  beginning  of  treatment  (OR=3.102,  95%  CI 1.325 to 5.450)

In an RCT comparing the effectiveness of sexual rehabilitation (physical exercise, pelvic floor exercise and psychoeducational consultation) with usual care among patients with ED and with either IHD and/or CAD, the former was superior in terms of: 94, level I

- improved sexual function with a mean difference in IIEF score of 6.7 (95% CI 3.1 to 10.4) at 4 months and 6.7 (95% CI 3.2 to 10.1) at six months
- improved  exercise  capacity  on  cycle  ergometer  measured  by Watt max (MD=10.3, 95% CI 3.6 to 16.9) and pelvic floor strength (p&lt;0.01)

- Certain drugs used for the management of cardiac conditions may need to be assessed in patients with ED.
-  The use of PDE5i is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates for cardiac conditions due to the risk of hypotension. 66, level III; 95, level III
- The appropriateness of using PDE5i is based on patient's cardiac status and medication regimen.
- A multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiologist, urologist, family medicine specialist, psychiatrist and/or rehabilitative physician are important in managing patients with ED and cardiac disease.

## 8.2 Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

The prevalence of ED among patients with DM is relatively high, thus they should be regularly screened for the medical condition and vice versa. Optimisation of glycaemic control and other risk factors should be advocated as the treatment of ED. Refer to CPG on Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (6th Edition). 96

## 8.3 Patients with Pelvic Surgery or Prostate Cancer Treatment

ED is a well-known complication of pelvic surgery especially for cancers e.g. rectal, prostate and bladder cancer. Potential mechanisms include direct injury to the neurovascular bundles (e.g. fibrosis and ischaemia) that control the complex mechanism  of the erectile response. Radical treatment for prostate cancer includes radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy  and  external  beam  radiotherapy  (EBRT)  which  can damage the neurovascular bundles.

A cohort study on patients diagnosed with locoregional prostate cancer treated with surgery or radiation showed: 97, level II-2

- ED was more prevalent in patients having prostatectomy compared with those receiving radiation (65.3% vs 33.8%, p&lt;0.001)
- radiation group had a greater median time to ED diagnosis (346 vs 133 days, p&lt;0.001)

A  systematic  review  reported  a  prevalence  of  ED  ranging  from 25 - 100% post-radical prostatectomy. 98, level III   This is supported by a narrative review that showed that the incidence was between 29% and88%. 99,  level  III Factors  predicting  preservation  of  EF  post-operatively include the patient's age, baseline EF and tumour size. 2

Patients  being  considered  for  nerve-sparing  radical  prostatectomy should  have  good  erectile  function  pre-operatively.  Post-operative erectile  function  recovery  can  occur  up  to  48  months  after  radical prostatectomy.  It  has  been  suggested  that  post-operative  therapy  of any type should be initiated as soon as possible after the surgery. 2

A Cochrane systematic review found that PDE5i was more effective than placebo in ED treatment post-nerve sparing open radical prostatectomy (OR=10.09, 95% CI 6.2 to 16.43). Analysis of two RCTs post-EBRT showed that PDE5i was also more effective than placebo in improving EF. However, the quality assessment for the RCTs on both outcomes was poor. 100, level I

In  another  meta-analysis  mentioned  earlier,  a  subgroup  analysis  on the effectiveness of tadalafil 5 mg once-a-day and tadalafil 20 mg ondemand dosing regimen in post-treatment for prostate cancer reported NS in  IIEF-EF  domain  score  but  significant  difference  favouring  the once-a-day regimen in SEP2. 61, level I

In  an  RCT  on  men  treated  for  ED  after  bilateral  nerve-sparing prostatectomy, combination of VED and tadalafil 20 mg vs tadalafil 20 mg alone was compared. It showed that the combination treatment had significantly higher: 101, level I

- IIEF scores at 6 - 12 months
- penile hardness scores after 6 - 9 months
- percentage of successful vaginal penetration at 3 - 9 months
- percentage of  ability to  have intercourse to  orgasm  at  six  and 12 months

The AEs of VED were minor local discomfort and that of tadalafil was headache, flushing and muscle ache.

- Multimodal  penile  rehabilitation  with  nerve  sparing  approach  may help to improve EF post-radical prostatectomy.

## 8.4 Spinal Cord Injury Survivors

SCI may lead to sensory, motor and autonomic abnormalities below the spinal lesion and complex urologic conditions. Approximately about 20 - 30% of SCI patients have either no erections or erection not sufficient for sexual intercourse. 102, level I  They are usually young individuals where sexuality and reproduction are important.

A  systematic  review  outlined  the  following  ED  treatment  options  in patients with SCI: 102, level I

| Treatment option                        | Effectiveness                                                                                                                                                  | Safety                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phosphodiesterase-5- inhibitors (PDE5i) | Improved erection, frequency of sexual intercourse, satisfaction, enjoyment,sexualdesire,overall sex life, sexual relationship and self-confidence in erection | Most common AEs were headache, dyspepsia, dizziness and rash                                                                                                                |
| Intracavernosal injection (ICI)         | 82 - 100% rate of adequate penile erection for sexual intercourse                                                                                              | It is associated with a high incidence of AEs which include priapism, pain, penile bruising or swelling.                                                                    |
| Vacuum erection device (VED)            | Successful vaginal penetration at 70 - 93%                                                                                                                     | Issue with lack of spontaneity, uncomfortable and sensation of the cold penis                                                                                               |
| Penile prosthesis (PP)                  | Satisfaction rate up to 79%                                                                                                                                    | Complications include infection and mechanical failures. Malleable implant is not recommended in men with spinal cord injury due to risk of erosion from lack of sensation. |
| Sacral neuromodulation                  | <50% effectiveness                                                                                                                                             | NoAEs have been reported                                                                                                                                                    |

- All of the above treatments may trigger autonomic dysreflexia* which can potentially be life-threatening in SCI patients.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a dangerous syndrome involving an overreaction of the autonomic nervous system. It causes a sudden and severe rise of blood pressure in addition to other symptoms (unopposed sympathetic  responses  e.g.  shortness  of  breath,  chest  tightness, flushing, throbbing headache and goosebumps).

## 9. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES

Implementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality healthcare  services  based  on  the  best  and  most  recent  available evidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications should be considered for the successful uptake of the CPG recommendations.

## 9.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors

The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:

- i) online  availability  of  CPG  on  multiple  websites  for  healthcare providers
2. ii) conferences  and  updates  on  the  management  of  ED  including those  involving  professional  bodies  (e.g.  Malaysian  Urological Association and Malaysian Society of Andrology and the Study of the Aging Male)
3. iii) public awareness campaigns on ED (e.g. Men's Health Day)

Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:

- i) different levels of expertise and wide variation in practice due to resource constraints
2. ii) limited awareness and knowledge in the management of ED among healthcare providers
3. iii) lack of confidence among healthcare providers in discussing ED with patients
4. iv)  social stigmatisation of ED among patients

## 9.2 Potential Resource Implications

The  prevalence  of  ED  is  increasing  which  renders  it  to  become  an emerging public health concern. This is made worse by the public and healthcare providers shying away from identifying and discussing the matter in the clinical practice. In diagnosing ED, healthcare providers require  expertise  (knowledge  and  skills)  to  elicit  the  problem  and provide further management on it. Rigorous work-up and cardiovascular assessment further complicate diagnosing ED. Treatment-wise, the  limited  availability  of  pharmacotherapy  and  mechanical  devices makes treating ED even more difficult. There is also an obvious lack of urologists and clinical psychologists especially in the public sector to help manage such cases.

In  line  with  the  key  recommendations  in  this  CPG,  the  following  is proposed as clinical audit indicator for the quality management of ED:

Percentage  of patients newly diagnosed with ED = assessed using IIEF-5

## Target of 100%

Percentage of ED patients with high cardiac risk based on Princeton Consensus referred to the cardiologist

## Target of 70%

Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of the CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module and they are available in the MoH and AMM websites after development.

## APPLICATION OF VACUUM ERECTILE DEVICE (VED)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The  equipment  consists  of  a vacuum chamber, a vacuum pump, and a constricting ring or band.
- The pump  can be operated manually as shown, but usually battery-operated for easy use.
- An elastic band is used to constrict  the  base  of  the  penis to  maintain  erection  after  it  is achieved.
- Before  the  device  is  used,  the constricting  band  is  lubricated with  a  water-soluble  jelly  and placed around the chamber near its open end.
- The jelly is next applied generously  to  the  base  of  the penis to assure an air-tight seal.
- The penis is placed in the chamber  and  the  vacuum  is applied for 3 - 6 minutes or until it becomes rigid.
- The  constricting band  is slid off  the  end  of  the  chamber  to constrict the base of the penis.
- The  vacuum  is  then  released and the chamber removed. Sexual intercourse can be performed immediately after.
- The band should not be left on longer than 30 minutes.

LOW-INTENSITY EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCKWAVE THERAPY

<!-- image -->

How it works?

While the patient is lying down, ultrasound gel is applied to the applicator head and/or the treatment area.

•

The applicator head is applied to areas of the penile shaft and crus.

•

The shockwave technology skilfully creates waves that treat a broad area from the superficial surface of the penile shaft to the deeper erectile

•

tissues of the crura.

It is currently recommended that this treatment to be conducted once or twice a week, for at least 6 sessions.

•

- The waves stimulate tissue and do not cause any pain or external scarring. Patients can resume daily regular activity after the procedure. Side

•

effects (if any) are usually mild and temporary.

## Most patients report progress after 3 - 4 sessions.
