## Overview

Certain patient populations require special considerations in the management of ED due to underlying conditions or unique circumstances.

---

## 8.1 Patients with Cardiac Disease

Managing ED in patients with cardiac disease requires a comprehensive approach.

### Prevalence
- Patients with atrial fibrillation showed an ED prevalence of 57% (95% CI 50 to 64) (91, level II-2)
- Patients with negative exercise stress test (EST) were less likely to have ED compared with those with positive EST (OR=0.18, p<0.001) (92, level II-2)

### Treatment Efficacy

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Sildenafil 50 mg was most effective (84% probability in SUCRA) in improving IIEF scores among patients with CV disorders | Level I |
| Vardenafil and udenafil had the best benefit-risk profiles | Level I |
| Tadalafil 10 mg on-demand improved IIEF scores in all risk groups (p<0.001) | Level II-3 |

### Factors Associated with Tadalafil Treatment Failure
- Increased HDL level by every 1 mg/dL (OR=1.022)
- Presence of hypertension (OR=2.217)
- Higher Framingham score (OR=4.127)
- Severe ED at the beginning of treatment (OR=3.102)

### Sexual Rehabilitation
An RCT comparing sexual rehabilitation (physical exercise, pelvic floor exercise and psychoeducational consultation) with usual care among patients with ED and IHD/CAD showed:
- Improved sexual function with IIEF score difference of 6.7 at 4 and 6 months
- Improved exercise capacity and pelvic floor strength

> **Critical Safety:** PDE5i is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates for cardiac conditions due to the risk of hypotension.

> **Recommendation:** A multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiologist, urologist, family medicine specialist, psychiatrist and/or rehabilitative physician are important in managing patients with ED and cardiac disease.

## 8.2 Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

The prevalence of ED among patients with DM is relatively high. They should be:
- Regularly screened for ED and vice versa
- Advocated for optimisation of glycaemic control and other risk factors

## 8.3 Patients with Pelvic Surgery or Prostate Cancer Treatment

ED is a well-known complication of pelvic surgery especially for cancers (e.g. rectal, prostate, bladder cancer). Potential mechanisms include direct injury to the neurovascular bundles that control the erectile response.

### Prevalence
| Treatment | ED Prevalence | Time to Diagnosis |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Prostatectomy | 65.3% | 133 days (median) |
| Radiation | 33.8% | 346 days (median) |
| Post-radical prostatectomy | 25-100% (review), 29-88% (narrative) | Up to 48 months recovery |

### Factors Predicting EF Preservation Post-operatively
- Patient's age
- Baseline erectile function
- Tumour size

### Treatment
- PDE5i was more effective than placebo post-nerve sparing open radical prostatectomy (OR=10.09)
- Combination of VED + Tadalafil 20 mg showed significantly higher IIEF scores at 6-12 months compared to Tadalafil alone

> **Recommendation:** Multimodal penile rehabilitation with nerve sparing approach may help improve EF post-radical prostatectomy. Post-operative therapy should be initiated as soon as possible after surgery.

## 8.4 Spinal Cord Injury Survivors

SCI may lead to sensory, motor and autonomic abnormalities below the spinal lesion and complex urologic conditions. Approximately 20-30% of SCI patients have either no erections or erection not sufficient for sexual intercourse.

### Treatment Options

| Treatment | Effectiveness | Safety |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **PDE5i** | Improved erection, sexual intercourse frequency, satisfaction, enjoyment, desire, overall sex life, sexual relationship and self-confidence | Most common AEs: headache, dyspepsia, dizziness, rash |
| **ICI** | 82-100% rate of adequate erection for intercourse | High incidence of AEs: priapism, pain, penile bruising/swelling |
| **VED** | Successful vaginal penetration: 70-93% | Lack of spontaneity, uncomfortable, sensation of cold penis |
| **Penile Prosthesis** | Satisfaction rate up to 79% | Infection, mechanical failures. Malleable implant NOT recommended due to erosion risk from lack of sensation |
| **Sacral Neuromodulation** | <50% effectiveness | No AEs reported |

> **Warning:** All treatments may trigger **autonomic dysreflexia** which can be life-threatening in SCI patients. This involves sudden and severe rise of blood pressure with symptoms including shortness of breath, chest tightness, flushing, throbbing headache and goosebumps.
