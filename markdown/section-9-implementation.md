## Overview

Implementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality healthcare services based on the best and most recent available evidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications should be considered for the successful uptake of the CPG recommendations.

## 9.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors

### Facilitating Factors

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Online availability | CPG available on multiple websites for healthcare providers |
| Conferences and updates | Involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Urological Association and Malaysian Society of Andrology and the Study of the Aging Male) |
| Public awareness campaigns | Men's Health Day and other initiatives |

### Limiting Factors

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resource constraints | Different levels of expertise and wide variation in practice |
| Limited awareness | Lack of knowledge in ED management among healthcare providers |
| Provider confidence | Lack of confidence in discussing ED with patients |
| Social stigma | Stigmatisation of ED among patients |

## 9.2 Potential Resource Implications

The prevalence of ED is increasing, making it an emerging public health concern. Challenges include:
- Public and healthcare providers shying away from discussing the matter
- Need for expertise (knowledge and skills) to elicit the problem
- Rigorous work-up and cardiovascular assessment requirements
- Limited availability of pharmacotherapy and mechanical devices
- Lack of urologists and clinical psychologists especially in the public sector

## Clinical Audit Indicators

### Indicator 1: IIEF-5 Assessment

**Measure:** Percentage of patients newly diagnosed with ED assessed using IIEF-5

**Formula:**
```
(Number of newly diagnosed ED patients assessed with IIEF-5 in a period / Total number of newly diagnosed ED patients in the same period) × 100%
```

**Target: 100%**

---

### Indicator 2: Cardiac Risk Referral

**Measure:** Percentage of ED patients with high cardiac risk based on Princeton Consensus referred to the cardiologist

**Formula:**
```
(Number of ED patients with high cardiac risk referred to cardiologist in a period / Total number of ED patients with high cardiac risk in the same period) × 100%
```

**Target: 70%**
