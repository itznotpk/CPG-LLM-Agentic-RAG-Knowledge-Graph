## 1. INTRODUCTION

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent and multifaceted medical condition characterised by the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. As a widespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life of affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress, strained relationships and diminished overall well-being.

ED can manifest in various forms:
*   **Organic ED:** Resulting from vascular, neurogenic, hormonal or anatomical factors.
*   **Psychogenic ED:** Associated with psychosocial issues.
*   **Mixed ED:** Combination of both organic and psychogenic factors.

The pathophysiology is complex, involving intricate interplay between vascular, neurologic, hormonal and psychological factors. Vascular insufficiency, endothelial dysfunction and altered smooth muscle tone are common contributors.

**Epidemiology:**
*   Global prevalence (1995): ~150 million men (projected to double by 2025).
*   Malaysia (Petaling District): 69.5% prevalence in males aged 40-79. Prevalence increases with age.
*   National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019: 31.6% moderate-to-severe ED in men aged ≥18.

ED is associated with co-morbidities (e.g., DM, CVD, depression) and is an **early marker of systemic vascular dysfunction**.

## 2. RISK FACTORS

There are various risk factors associated with ED. A person may have more than one risk factor at a time.

### 2.1 Age
Prevalence increases significantly with age. Men aged ≥60 years are strongly associated with moderate-to-severe ED (OR=3.04).

### 2.2 Lifestyle Behaviours

| Factor | Association with ED | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diet** | High fruit/vegetable/flavonoid intake and Mediterranean diet reduce risk. | Level II-2 |
| **Physical Activity** | Moderate intensity activity (>1-2 days/week) reduces risk. | Level III |
| **Obesity** | BMI ≥29 kg/m² increases risk (OR=1.78). | Level III |
| **Smoking** | Independent risk factor (OR=1.41) with dose-response relationship. | Level III |
| **Alcohol** | Light/moderate consumption may be beneficial; high consumption is not. | Level III |
| **Recreational Drugs** | Amphetamine, cannabis, opioid, ecstasy increase risk. | Level II-2 |
| **Pornography** | Problematic consumption and preference for masturbation with pornography increase risk. | Level III |
| **Partner's Dysfunction** | Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) increases likelihood of ED (OR=3.80). | Level III |

> **Note on Cycling:** Some studies suggest cyclists may have higher odds of ED, but primary studies were of fair/poor quality.

### 2.3 Co-morbidities

| Condition | Risk/Association | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diabetes Mellitus** | 59.1% prevalence among diabetics; OR=3.62 vs healthy controls. | Level III |
| **Hypertension** | Risk factor (OR=1.61). | Level III |
| **Cardiovascular Diseases** | High prevalence in IHD (90.4%) and post-MI (62%). | Level III |
| **End-Stage Renal Disease** | High prevalence (71%), highest in pre-dialysis. | Level II-2 |
| **Hyperuricaemia** | Associated with increased risk. | Level II-2 |
| **Obstructive Sleep Apnoea** | Prevalence of ED 40.9-80% in OSA patients. | Level II-2 |
| **Chronic Prostatitis/CPPS** | Higher risk (OR=2.68). | Level II-2 |
| **Depression** | Higher odds (OR=2.55). | Level II-2 |
| **Anxiety** | Prevalence ~20%. | Level III |
| **Hypogonadism** | Higher risk in secondary hypogonadism. | Level III |
| **Traumatic Brain Injuries** | Higher rate and risk of ED, often dose-dependent on severity. | Level II-2 |

### 2.4 Medications

Certain medications are associated with drug-induced ED:

*   **Antihypertensives:** Thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers. (Nebivolol may have beneficial effects compared to non-vasodilatory beta-blockers).
*   **Finasteride:** 1mg/day associated with increased risk compared to placebo.
*   **Psychotropic Agents:** Serotogenic antidepressants (SSRIs, tricyclics) and antipsychotics associated with increased risk.
*   **Statins:** No association found with incidence of ED in patients with CVD risk.
