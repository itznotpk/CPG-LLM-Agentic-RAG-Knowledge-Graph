## Overview

ED can be treated with multiple therapeutic options. These include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological agents, mechanical devices, surgeries and psychological interventions. It should be a dynamic process resulting in a patient-centred treatment strategy that depends on the effectiveness, safety and cost of the treatment. Shared decision-making (preferably with a partner) is essential throughout the management of ED.

---

## 4.1 Lifestyle Intervention

ED is strongly associated with lifestyle risk factors. Addressing these factors is important in the treatment of ED.

### Evidence Summary

| Intervention | Effect | Evidence |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **CV risk factor modifications** (physical activity, Mediterranean diet, weight loss) | Improved IIEF-5 score (MD=2.40, 95% CI 1.19-3.61) compared with those not receiving the interventions | Level I |
| **Aerobic exercise** (moderate-vigorous intensity, ≥3x/week, ≥30 min/session) | Improved IIEF/IIEF-5 for arterial ED  for men with arterial ED due to physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and/or CVD compared with controls | Level I |
| **Weight loss** (low-energy diet + physical exercises) | Improved erectile function (MD of IIEF=1.99, 95% CI 0.85-3.13) | Level I |
| **Bariatric surgery** (BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with co-morbidities) | Significantly improved IIEF scores | Level II-3 |
| **Pelvic floor muscle training** (5-20 therapist-supervised sessions, 3-4 months) | 35-47% cure rate in ED | Level II-3 |
| **Smoking cessation** | Improved ED irrespective of pack-years and severity | Level II-3 |
| **Alcohol abstinence** (3 months) | Improved IIEF-5 scores (p<0.001) | Level II-2 |

### Stress Management and Psychotherapy

In managing stress, counselling is helpful as an initial step to provide support and guidance regarding ED.

Psychotherapy, on the other hand, goes one step further and is directed towards gaining insights into chronic and recurrent emotional and cognitive patterns, and their contribution to ED (refer to Subchapter 3.5 Psychological Interventions).

> **EAU Guidelines 2023:** Modify risk factors and commence lifestyle changes prior to or concurrently with ED treatments.

### Recommendation 2

- All patients with erectile dysfunction should be advised on lifestyle and risk factor modifications.

---

## 4.2 Pharmacological Treatment

The main pharmacological agents for ED are phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5is). They are contraindicated 
in patients taking nitric oxide (NO) donors, organic nitrates or organic nitrites (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate). These agents cause corporeal smooth muscle relaxation, increased arterial blood flow and compression of sub-tunical venous plexus leading to erection.

> **Important:** PDE5is are not initiators of erection; they require environmental and psychological cues for sufficient sexual arousal and stimulation to facilitate an erection.

> **Reference:** For detailed dosing, contraindications, and dose adjustments, see [Appendix 6: Treatment in ED](appendix-6-treatment.md).

### 4.2.1 Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5i)

#### PDE5i Comparison Table

| Drug | Onset | Duration | Initial Dose | Max Dose | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Sildenafil** | 30-60 min | Up to 12h | 50 mg | 100 mg | First PDE5i available in market |
| **Tadalafil** | - | - | 10 mg (on-demand) or 2.5 mg (daily) | 20 mg (on-demand) or 5 mg (daily) | 5 mg daily more effective than placebo for LUTS/BPH/ED |
| **Avanafil** | ≤15 min | >6 hours | - | - | Onset/duration from RCT in DM patients |
| **Vardenafil** | - | - | - | - | *Not registered in Malaysia* |

#### Sildenafil

- First available PDE5i; recommended initial dose 50 mg
- Improved IIEF-5 scores in patients with DM and/or hypertension (from 13.6±5.7 to 21.7±4.1 at 12 weeks)
- Common AEs: headache (5.5%), flushing (1.9%), nasal congestion (1.3%)

#### Tadalafil

- Tadalafil was well tolerated although the AEs were not specified.
- Available as on-demand (10-20 mg) or once-daily (2.5-5 mg) regimen
- 5 mg once-daily more effective than 20 mg on-demand at 12 weeks (WMD=1.51, 95% CI 0.49-2.53)
- Higher risk of myalgia and back pain compared to sildenafil; lower risk of flushing

#### Avanafil

- 200 mg dose significantly better than 100 mg in IIEF score and successful intercourse
- For AEs, avanafil had a higher risk compared with placebo (RR=1.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.31). 
- Effective in DM and ED patients; can be initiated in ≤15 minutes
- Common AEs: headache, nasopharyngitis, flushing, sinus congestion

#### Vardenafil

- Significantly more effective than placebo in IIEF-overall satisfaction, SEP2 and SEP3 scores
- **Not registered in Malaysia**

> **Safety Alert:** Patients should stop PDE5i and seek immediate medical care for sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes (possible NAION). Patients with history of NAION may be prescribed PDE5i with caution.

### Recommendation 3

- Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with erectile dysfunction unless contraindicated.
- The choice of agent is individualised.

---

### 4.2.2 Combination Therapy

Combination of PDE5i with various agents (alpha-blocker, testosterone, antioxidants) was more effective than PDE5i monotherapy (WMD in IIEF score=1.76, 95% CI 1.27-2.24) with NS difference in AEs.

> **EAU Guidelines 2023:** recommend PDE5is as first-line therapeutic option. Choice of drug depends on frequency of intercourse and patient's personal experience.

---

### 4.2.3 Other Medications

#### Intracavernosal Injection (ICI)

- First medical treatment for ED; only FDA-approved preparation is alprostadil
- Adequate penile rigidity restored in 60.2% of patients
- AEs: pain during self-injection (45.9%), prolonged erection (23-44.4%), penile curvature (14.9%), palpable plaque (10.8%)
- Overall satisfaction: 40.1%
- Caution with anticoagulation (higher bleeding risk, though NS)

#### Intraurethral Alprostadil

Two methods of administration:
1. **MUSE** (Medicated Urethral System for Erection): pellet inserted into urethra
2. **Topical cream**: applied to urethra meatus or glans penis

- MUSE: significant improvement in erection vs placebo, but inferior to ICI
- Topical alprostadil: 74% showed overall improvement in EF
- Common AEs: local pain (29-41%), dizziness with possible hypotension (1.9-14%)
- Rare AEs: penile fibrosis and priapism (<1%)
- If administered into urethra: urethral bleeding (5%), urinary tract infections (0.2%)

> **Note:** ICI and intraurethral alprostadil are treatment options for ED. However, both are not available locally yet.

---

## 4.3 Mechanical Treatment

Mechanical devices have been used with success and are safe to maintain an erection.

### 4.3.1 Vacuum Erection Device (VED)

**Effectiveness:**
- 96.0% reported ability to maintain an erection
- 90.7% able to engage in intercourse
- 92.0% had improved intercourse
- 93.9% reported satisfactory sexual relationship with partner
- 83.8% of female partners rated sex as better
- 23% of patients reported physical discomfort (difficulties placing the bands on cylinder, sliding them on the penis, removing them after sex or pain)
- 9.1% of patients reported psychological discomfort (frustration, lack of spontaneity)

**Combination with PDE5i:**
- VED + sildenafil 100 mg vs sildenafil alone showed significantly higher IIEF scores at one month and three months
- significantly higher rates of successful penetration  and successful intercourse at three months

**AEs:**
- Penile bruising and numbness (mostly mild)

---

### 4.3.2 Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (Li-ESWT)

**Effectiveness:**
- Improved erectile function in young patients with vasculogenic mild ED
- Increased IIEF-EF scores at 3 months (p=0.003)
- Effective from 3-6 months
- Enhanced medication responses in PDE5i non-responders
- When used with daily therapy, increased effectiveness and duration

**Best Candidates:**
- Younger men with mild to moderate ED
- Those with fewer co-morbidities

> **Note:** Li-ESWT should be performed only by urologists as they are involved in entire holistic management and understand mechanisms of action to tailor treatment plan.

### Recommendation 4

- Mechanical devices (e.g. vacuum erection device or shockwave therapy) may be offered in erectile dysfunction (ED).
- Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by urologists for mild to moderate ED.

---

## 4.4 Surgical Intervention

Surgical interventions in ED include penile revascularisation surgery and penile prosthesis (PP).

### 4.4.1 Penile Revascularisation Surgery

#### Arterial Insufficiency (AI)

arterial insufficiency occurs when there is inadequate arterial blood to the penis at the time of erection.

**Candidate Criteria (ICSM Consensus):**
- Age <55 years
- Recently acquired ED from focal arterial occlusive disease
- Absence of other risk factors (e.g. smoking, DM)

**Procedures:** Microsurgery or endovascular intervention (current data do not support one over another)

**Complications:**
- Microsurgery: wound infection (2.8%), UTI (2.6%), wound haematoma (7.8-25%), loss of penile length (28%), decreased penile sensitivity (24.7%)
- Endovascular: vascular injury, puncture site aneurysm, infection, contrast-induced nephropathy

#### Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD)

VOD occurs when erection cannot be achieved/maintained despite adequate arterial supply, due to endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction.

> **ICSM and EAU Guidelines 2023:** Venous surgery or embolisation is NOT recommended for VOD.

---

### 4.4.2 Penile Prosthesis (PP)

Used when other type of treatment modalities have failed.

**Types:**
- Malleable
- 2-piece inflatable
- 3-piece inflatable systems

**Outcomes:**
- Overall patient satisfaction: 85%
- Partner satisfaction: 76%
- 52.9% inflatable PP device survived at 20 years

**AEs:**
- Mechanical failure: <5% in 5 years
- Infection: 2-3% in low-risk patients (higher in revision surgery, immunosuppression, DM, SCI)
- Implant erosion: 1-6%
- Glans ischaemia and necrosis (rare)

> **Note:** Vascular ED should be suspected in patients with ED at younger age with absence of other risk factors.

### Recommendation 5

Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with erectile dysfunction who have failed other interventions.

---

## 4.5 Psychological Intervention

<!-- METADATA
category: treatment
treatment_type: psychological
use_case: psychogenic_ED, mixed_ED
-->

Psychosocial intervention plays a vital role in ED treatment as psychological and social factors often pre-dispose and perpetuate erectile problems. Partner involvement is recommended to identify shared sexual difficulties.

> **Core Components:** Psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioural techniques (reducing anxiety, challenging dysfunctional beliefs), increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance, and increasing intimacy.

### Evidence Summary

| Intervention | Outcome | Evidence |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Focused sex-group therapy** | Reduced persistence of ED vs control (RR=0.13) | Level I |
| **Group therapy + Sildenafil** | Better reduction of persistent ED vs Sildenafil alone (RR=0.46) | Level I |
| **Combined Treatment** (Psych + PDE5i) | Superior to PDE5i or Psych intervention alone (Cohen's d=0.45, RR=2.26) | Level I |
| **Internet-based interventions (IMIs)** | Small effect size (g=0.18) in improving sexual function | Level I |

> **Note:** Combined treatment (PDE5i + Psychological intervention) consistently shows better efficacy than monotherapy for psychogenic or PDE5i alone.

### Recommendation 6

Psychological interventions should be considered in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

-->

### Equipment
- Vacuum chamber
- Vacuum pump (manual or battery-operated)
- Constricting ring or band

### Application Steps

1. **Preparation:** Lubricate the constricting band with water-soluble jelly and place it around the chamber near its open end.

2. **Apply lubricant:** Apply jelly generously to the base of the penis to assure an air-tight seal.

3. **Insert penis:** Place the penis in the chamber.

4. **Create vacuum:** Apply the vacuum for 3-6 minutes or until the penis becomes rigid.

5. **Transfer band:** Slide the constricting band off the end of the chamber to constrict the base of the penis.

6. **Release vacuum:** Release the vacuum and remove the chamber.

7. **Proceed:** Sexual intercourse can be performed immediately after.

> **Warning:** The band should NOT be left on longer than 30 minutes.

## APPENDIX 8: LOW-INTENSITY EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCKWAVE THERAPY (Li-ESWT)

<!-- METADATA
category: treatment_procedure
treatment_type: mechanical
-->

### How It Works

1. While the patient is lying down, ultrasound gel is applied to the applicator head and/or the treatment area.

2. The applicator head is applied to areas of the penile shaft and crus.

3. The shockwave technology creates waves that treat a broad area from the superficial surface of the penile shaft to the deeper erectile tissues of the crura.

### Treatment Protocol

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Frequency** | Once or twice a week |
| **Minimum sessions** | 6 sessions |
| **Progress expected** | After 3-4 sessions |

### Safety

- The waves stimulate tissue and do NOT cause any pain or external scarring
- Patients can resume daily regular activity after the procedure
- Side effects (if any) are usually mild and temporary

## APPENDIX 9: EXAMPLES OF PENILE PROSTHESIS

<!-- METADATA
category: treatment_device
treatment_type: surgical
-->

### Types of Penile Prosthesis

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Three-piece inflatable prosthesis** | Provides most natural erection; consists of cylinders, pump, and reservoir |
| **Two-piece inflatable device** | Simpler than three-piece; cylinders and pump combined |
| **Malleable prosthesis** | Semi-rigid rods; manually positioned for intercourse |

### Selection Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Manual dexterity** | Malleable may be better for patients with limited hand function |
| **Body habitus** | Reservoir placement may be an issue in obese patients |
| **Prior surgery** | May affect device placement options |
| **SCI patients** | Malleable NOT recommended due to erosion risk from lack of sensation |
